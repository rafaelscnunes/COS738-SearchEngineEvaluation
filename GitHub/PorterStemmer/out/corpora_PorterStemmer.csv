1;THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA INFECTION IN THE RESPIRATORY TRACT OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY MEANS OF IMMUNOELECTROPHORETICAL ANALYSIS OF PATIENTS SERA FOR THE NUMBER OF PRECIPITINS AGAINST PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA AND THE CONCENTRATIONS OF SERUM PROTEINS IN ADDITION THE CLINICAL AND RADIOGRAPHICAL STATUS OF THE LUNGS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED USING SCORING SYSTEMS PRECIPITINS AGAINST PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA WERE DEMONSTRATED IN ALL SERA THE MAXIMUM NUMBER IN ONE SERUM WAS THE CONCENTRATIONS OF OF THE SERUM PROTEINS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED COMPARED WITH MATCHED CONTROL PERSONS NOTABLY IGG AND IGA WERE ELEVATED AND THE ACUTE PHASE PROTEINS WERE CHANGED THE LATTER SUGGESTING ACTIVE TISSUE DAMAGE THE CONCENTRATIONS OF OF THE ACUTE PHASE PROTEINS NOTABLY HAPTOGLOBIN WERE CORRELATED TO THE NUMBER OF PRECIPITINS SUGGESTING THAT THE RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION IN PATIENTS WITH MANY PRECIPITINS IS ACCOMPANIED BY MORE TISSUE DAMAGE THAN THE INFECTION IN PATIENTS WITH FEW PRECIPITINS THE RESULTS INDICATE NO PROTECTIVE VALUE OF THE MANY PRECIPITINS ON THE TISSUE OF THE RESPIRATORY TRACT
2;SALIVARY AMYLASE LEVELS WERE DETERMINED IN NORMAL SUBJECTS FROM BIRTH UNTIL ADULT LIFE AND IN CHILDREN WITH CONDITIONS SOMETIMES ASSOCIATED WITH LOW PANCREATIC AMYLASE SUCH AS MALNUTRITION COELIAC DISEASE AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS MIXED SALIVA WAS COLLECTED UNDER CAREFULLY STANDARDISED CONDITIONS AND AMYLASE WAS MEASURED BY THE METHOD OF DAHLQVIST THERE WAS A WIDE SCATTER OF VALUES IN THE NORMAL SUBJECTS BUT CONCENTRATIONS ROSE FROM VERY LOW LEVELS AT BIRTH TO REACH ADULT LEVELS BY THE AGE OF MONTHS TO YEAR SALIVARY AMYLASE ACTIVITY ROSE NORMALLY OVER TEN WEEKS IN ONE PREMATURE INFANT FED MILK BY GASTROSTOMY THIRTEEN CHILDREN WITH COELIAC DISEASE AND CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS MOSTLY HAD NORMAL SALIVARY AMYLASE CONCENTRATIONS SIX OUT OF MALNOURISHED CHILDREN WITH JEJUNAL VILLOUS ATROPHY OF UNCERTAIN AETIOLOGY HAD LOW LEVELS WHICH ROSE TO NORMAL AS RECOVERY BEGAN
3;THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF USING INSTRUMENTAL NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS INAA OF SODIUM IN NAIL CLIPPINGS FOR DIAGNOSING CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS FOR DETECTING HETEROZYGOTES AND FOR SCREENING IN THE NEONATAL PERIOD NAIL CLIPPINGS FROM NEWBORNS CF PATIENTS TWO OF THEM NEWBORNS HEALTHY CONTROLS AND HETEROZYGOTES WERE ANALYZED THE DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN CF PATIENTS AND CONTROLS WAS FOUND TO BE PRECISE FOR INDIVIDUALS ABOVE ONE YEAR OF AGE AND INAA OF NAIL CLIPPINGS SHOULD BE ACCEPTED AS A DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR CF AFTER THIS AGE HETEROZYGOTES COULD NOT BE DETECTED BY THE METHOD DURING THE FIRST FIVE DAYS OF LIFE THERE IS A BIG OVERLAP BETWEEN THE VALUES FROM NORMAL NEWBORNS AND THOSE OF CF CHILDREN WHICH MAKES THE METHOD INVALUABLE FOR EARLY SCREENING FOR CF
4;INSTRUMENTAL NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS INAA OF NAIL CLIPPINGS WAS USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DIAGNOSTIC METHOD FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF FROM CF PATIENTS AND CONTROLS MORE THAN THREE YEARS OLD NAIL CLIPPINGS WERE SAMPLED FOR TESTS OF DIFFERENT ERRORS AS A RESULT OF THIS STUDY A PRECISE COLLECTION ROUTINE WAS OUTLINED SODIUM IS EASILY WASHED OUT FROM NAIL CLIPPINGS THE RISK OF SODIUM CONTAMINATION OF THE NAILS SEEMS TO BE SMALL THE SODIUM DISTRIBUTION IN THE NAIL IS INHOMOGENEOUS AND THE SODIUM CONTENT VARIES ALSO FROM NAIL TO NAIL IN THE SAME PERSON THERE IS GOOD EVIDENCE THAT THE INCREASED SODIUM IN THE NAILS OF CF PATIENTS COMES FROM THE SWEAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A BASIC INTRINSIC SODIUM LEVEL WHICH IS ABOUT THE SAME IN THE NAILS OF CF PATIENTS AS IN CONTROLS THE PRECISION AND ACCURACY OF INAA FOR DETERMINING SODIUM IN NAILS IS CONSIDERED SATISFACTORY IT IS CONCLUDED THAT INAA OF THE SODIUM CONCENTRATION IN NAIL CLIPPINGS IS A SUITABLE METHOD AS AN AID IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF CF IF A PRECISE COLLECTION ROUTINE IS USED
5;THE CAPACITY OF DUODENAL JUICE TO HYDROLYSE CASEIN TO TRICHLOROACETIC ACID SOLUBLE PEPTIDES WAS INVESTIGATED IN A CONTROL GROUP INFANTS AND CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN CHILDREN WITH PANCREATIC DISEASE IN CHILDREN WITH ENTEROGENIC MALABSORPTION COELIAC DISEASE AND COW S MILK PROTEIN INTOLERANCE THE PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY PER ML DUODENAL JUICE IN FASTING CONDITION WAS AS GREAT IN HEALTHY INFANTS AND CHILDREN AS HEALTHY ADULTS MG CASEIN ML HOUR THERE WAS A GOOD CORRELATION BETWEEN TRYPSIN CONTENT AND PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY OF DUODENAL JUICE IN PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY THE PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY WAS EXTREMELY LOW NOT MEASURABLE IN PATIENTS AS WAS THE TRYPSIN ACTIVITY WHEREAS IN ENTEROGENIC MALABSORPTION IT WAS WITHIN THE RANGES OF THE CONTROLS
6;THE INFLUENCE OF CHRONIC PS AERUGINOSA INFECTION ON THE OCCURRENCE OF BONE MARROW DERIVED LYMPHOCYTES B CELLS AND THYMUS DERIVED LYMPHOCYTES T CELLS IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN GROUPS OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ONE GROUP PATIENTS SUFFERED FROM CHRONIC PS AERUGINOSA INFECTION IN THE RESPIRATORY TRACT AND PRODUCED MULTIPLE PS AERUGINOSA PRECIPITINS WHICH WERE DEMONSTRATED BY MEANS OF CROSSED IMMUNOELECTROPHORESIS THE OTHER GROUP PATIENTS HAD NEVER HARBOURED PS AERUGINOSA IN THE RESPIRATORY TRACT AND PRESENTED NO DEMONSTRABLE PRECIPITINS AGAINST THIS BACTERIA THE LYMPHOCYTES WERE EXAMINED FOR THE PRESENCE OF SURFACE MARKERS FOR B CELLS RECEPTOR FOR C COMPLEMENT COMPONENT EAC ROSETTE FORMATION AND SURFACE IMMUNOGLOBULINS IMMUNOFLUORESCENT STAINING AND FOR THE PRESENCE OF SURFACE MARKER FOR T CELLS SPONTANEOUS BINDING OF SHEEP RED BLOOD CELLS E ROSETTE FORMATION THE B T CELL RATIO WAS NEARLY IDENTICAL IN THE GROUPS OF PATIENTS WHEREAS THE TOTAL NUMBERS OF B AND T CELLS WERE SIGNIFICANT HIGHER IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PS AERUGINOSA INFECTION THE NUMBER OF PS AERUGINOSA PRECIPITINS PER SERUM WAS SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF T CELLS WHERAS THE CORRELATION WITH THE TOTAL NUMBER OF B CELLS WAS INSIGNIFICANT
7;THE OCCURRENCE OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA IN THE RESPIRATORY TRACT OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS AND THE OCCURRENCE OF PRECIPITINS AGAINST PS AERUGINOSA IN SERA FROM THE SAME PATIENTS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED DURING ONE YEAR BY MEANS OF MONTHLY BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS OF TRACHEAL SECRETIONS AND BY MEANS OF CROSSED IMMUNOELECTROPHORESIS OF A POLYVALENT PS AERUGINOSA ANTIGEN AGAINST SERA FROM THE PATIENTS THE ONE YEAR PERIOD PREVALENCE RATE OF PATIENTS HARBOURING PS AERUGINOSA WAS PER CENT IN NEWLY COLONIZED PATIENTS AND IN INTERMITTENTLY COLONIZED PATIENTS NON MUCOID STRAINS WERE PREDOMINATING WHEREAS MUCOID STRAINS WERE PREDOMINATING IN CHRONICALLY COLONIZED PATIENTS THE OCCURRENCE OF MUCOID STRAINS ESPECIALLY IN CHRONICALLY COLONIZED PATIENTS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER OF PRECIPITINS AGAINST PS AERUGINOSA THAN THE OCCURRENCE OF NON MUCOID STRAINS MALES CHRONICALLY COLONIZED WITH MUCOID STRAINS PRESENTED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER OF PRECIPITINS THAN FEMALES CHRONICALLY COLONIZED WITH MUCOID STRAINS AND THE NUMBER OF PRECIPITINS WAS CORRELATED WITH THE DURATION OF THE CHRONIC COLONIZATION WITH PS AERUGINOSA IN MALES IN CONTRAST TO FEMALES THE RESULTS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MUCOID SUBSTANCE COULD BE A VIRULENCE FACTOR BECAUSE IT MIGHT INHIBIT THE OPSONIZING EFFECT OF THE PRECIPITINS ON THE MUCOID CELLS AND THE COMPLEMENT DEPENDENT LYSIS OF THE CELLS HEREBY FAVOURING MUCOID STRAINS AT THE EXPENSE ON NON MUCOID STRAINS IN THE RESPIRATORY TRACT OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS
8;SEVENTY PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS TREATED AS OUT PATIENTS IN A CYSTIC FIBROSIS CLINIC HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED DURING ONE YEAR BY MONTHLY BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS OF TRACHEAL SECRETIONS THE DAILY IMPRESSION OBTAINED IN THE LABORATORY IS EXPRESSED BY THE MEAN POINT PREVALENCE RATE OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA PER CENT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS PER CENT HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE PER CENT DIPLOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE PER CENT AND MISCELLANEOUS OTHER BACTERIA MAINLY ENTEROBACTERIACEAE PER CENT THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE BACTERIOLOGY ARE DESCRIBED BY ADDITIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL TERMS AT ONE OR MORE EXAMINATIONS DURING THE STUDY PERIOD PREVALENCE RATE PER CENT OF THE PATIENTS HARBOURED ST AUREUS PER CENT PS AERUGINOSA MAINLY MUCOID STRAINS PER CENT H INFLUENZAE PER CENT D PNEUMONIAE AND PER CENT MISCELLANEOUS OTHER BACTERIA MAINLY ENTEROBACTERIACEAE THIS PATTERN WAS FOUND IN ALL AGE GROUPS WITH MINOR AGE DEPENDENT MODIFICATIONS ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS ENTEROBACTERIACEAE PS AERUGINOSA WAS PREDOMINATING AS REGARDS CHRONIC COLONIZATION WHICH REFLECTS THE MOST DIFFICULT THERAPEUTIC PROBLEMS THE PERIOD PREVALENCE RATE BEING PER CENT IN CONTRAST TO ST AUREUS PER CENT AND H INFLUENZAE PER CENT ST AUREUS WAS PREDOMINATING AS REGARDS NEW COLONIZATION AND RECOLONIZATION WHICH REFLECT THE PROBLEMS OF PREVENTION THE INCIDENCE RATE OF NEW COLONIZATION AND RECOLONIZATION PER RISK GROUP BEING PER CENT FOLLOWED BY H INFLUENZAE PER CENT PS AERUGINOSA PER CENT AND D PNEUMONIAE PER CENT THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE BACTERIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS ARE STILL CONSIDERABLE AS REGARDS THERAPY AS WELL AS PREVENTION ALTHOUGH MANY SPECIES MAY COLONIZE THE RESPIRATORY TRACTS OF THESE PATIENTS THE MAIN CLINICAL PROBLEMS CONCERN PS AERUGINOSA AND ST AUREUS THE REASON WHY IS DISCUSSED
9;A FAMILY IS PRESENTED IN WHICH CELIAC SPRUE AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS OCCURRED WITHIN THE SAME SIBSHIP A COUSIN OF THE INDEX CASE WAS ALSO DISCOVERED TO HAVE CELIAC SPRUE THE GENETICS AND INCIDENCE OF BOTH CONDITIONS IS REVIEWED IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS ASSOCIATION OCCURRING ON THE BASIS OF CHANCE IN THIS FAMILY IS IN
10;A PATIENT EXHIBITED THE FEATURES OF BOTH KARTAGENER SYNDROME AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS AT MOST TO THE AUTHORS KNOWLEDGE THIS REPRESENTS THE THIRD SUCH REPORT OF THE COMBINATION CYSTIC FIBROSIS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED BEFORE A DIAGNOSIS OF KARTAGENER SYNDROME IS MADE
11;THE PREVALENCE OF RESPIRATORY ALLERGIES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE COURSE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF WERE STUDIED IN PATIENTS FIFTEEN PATIENTS HAD RESPIRATORY ALLERGIES AS DEFINED BY HISTORY PHYSICAL EXAMINATION POSITIVE ALLERGY SKIN TESTS NASAL AND PERIPHERAL EOSINOPHILIA AND REVERSIBLE AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION SERUM IMMUNOGLOBULINS ON THESE ALLERGIC CF AND NONALLERGIC CF PATIENTS WERE ELEVATED WHEN COMPARED WITH THOSE IN NORMAL AGE MATCHED CONTROLS THE ALLERGIC CF PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IGE LEVELS MEAN INTERNATIONAL UNITS IU COMPARED TO IU IGG IGM AND IGA LEVELS WERE SIMILAR IN THE TWO CF GROUPS THE CLINICAL CONDITION OF THE ALLERGIC CF PATIENTS SHWACHMAN SCORE WAS BETTER THAN THE NONALLERGIC SUGGESTING SOME MODULATING EFFECT OF RESPIRATORY ALLERGY ON THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE
12;TAUSSIG ET AL REPORTED A CASE OF A YEAR OLD BOY WITH THE RUSSELL VARIANT OF THE SILVER RUSSELL SYNDROME CONCOMITANT WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WE WOULD LIKE TO DESCRIBE ANOTHER PATIENT WHO HAD THE SAME COMBINATION OF DISEASES THE PATTERN OF CLINICAL FINDINGS IN THIS PATIENT ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT OF THE SILVER RUSSELL SYNDROME IT IS OF COURSE POSSIBLE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN THIS PATIENT IS ENTIRELY ACCIDENTAL ALTHOUGH SUCH A COINCIDENCE WOULD BE A STATISTICALLY RARE EVENT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO CONDITIONS WOULD DEPEND ON REPORTS OF OTHER SIMILAR CASES
13;AN INTENSIVE SEARCH FOR BLACKS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF IN WASHINGTON DC DURING THE PERIOD TO DISCLOSED BLACK PATIENTS EIGHT OF WHOM WERE BORN IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DURING THIS DECADE THE CALCULATED INCIDENCE OF CF IS AT LEAST ONE IN BLACK NEWBORNS THE CLINICAL COURSE AND PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN BLACKS WITH CF ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN WHITES GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS POINT TO AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE INHERITANCE IN BLACKS WHICH IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED FOR WHITES WITH THIS DISEASE
14;PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS OF GENETIC DISORDERS HAS RECEIVED INCREASING ATTENTION DURING THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS RAPID EXPANSION OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE BASIS OF GENETIC DISEASE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF RELIABLE DIAGNOSTIC METHODS HAVE LED TO RAPID ADVANCES IN THE INTRAUTERINE DIAGNOSIS OF A LARGE NUMBER OF INHERITED DISORDERS PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS WAS INITIALLY USED TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF DOWN S SYNDROME AND OTHER CHROMOSOMAL ABNORMALITIES AND FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FETAL SEX IN PREGNANCIES AT RISK FOR A NUMBER OF SEVERE X LINKED RECESSIVE DISORDERS SHORTLY THEREAFTER IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE SAME TECHNIQUES COULD BE APPLIED TO THE PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS OF A NUMBER OF THE INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM MOST RECENTLY A NUMBER OF NEW TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THAT MAY PROVE TO BE OF GREAT VALUE IN THE PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS OF A NUMBER OF SEVERE CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS THAT BEFORE NOW COULD NOT BE DIAGNOSED PRIOR TO BIRTH THE GOAL OF THIS REVIEW IS TO DEFINE THE PAST ACHIEVEMENTS FUTURE GOALS AND PRESENT LIMITATIONS OF INTRAUTERINE DIAGNOSIS THE FIRST SECTION WILL DEAL WITH THE GENERAL APPROACHES USED IN PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS OF GENETIC DISORDERS THIS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF THE SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS OF THE BASIC TECHNIQUES TO THE INTRAUTERINE DIAGNOSIS OF CHROMOSOMAL ABNORMALITIES AND OF THE INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM APPROACHES TO PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS OF GENETIC DISORDERS INCLUDE AMNIOCENTESIS DIRECT AND INDIRECT VISUALIZATION OF THE FETUS ANALYSIS OF MATERNAL BLOOD AND URINE AND SAMPLING OF FETAL TISSUES APPLICATIONS OF PRENATAL GENETIC DIAGNOSIS INCLUDE X LINKED RECESSIVE DISORDERS CHROMOSOMAL ABNORMALITIES INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM DISORDERS OF LIPID METABOLISM DISORDERS OF CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM DISORDERS OF MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDE METABOLISM DISORDERS OF AMINO ACID METABOLISM AND MISCELLANEOUS DISORDERS SUCH AS CYSTIC FIBROSIS THESE TECHNIQUES PROVIDE SOME PARENTS WITH METHODS FOR HAVING CHILDREN WITHOUT FEAR OF HAVING A CHILD WITH A SPECIFIC DEFORMITY IN ADDITION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF APPROACHES WHICH WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DISORDERS DETECTABLE IN UTERO THE POTENTIAL FOR TREATMENT OF GENETIC DISORDERS IS UNLIMITED
15;THREE OF THE WOMEN IN A CYSTIC FIBROSIS CLINIC WHO USED A COMBINED FORM OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE DEVELOPED ACUTE POLYPOID CERVICITIS IN ONE WOMAN THE POLYP RECURRED ON REINSTITUTION OF THE MEDICATION THERE WAS RESOLUTION OF THE POLYP IN EACH INSTANCE ON DISCONTINUATION OF THE DRUGS IN OF THE AFFECTED WOMEN THERE WAS COINCIDENTAL DETERIORATION OF RESPIRATORY STATUS THEREFORE IT IS SUGGESTED THAT CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS WHO ARE USING ORAL CONTRACEPTION BE OBSERVED CLOSELY REGARDING PULMONARY AND GYNECOLOGIC STATUS
16;THE SYNDROME OF ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA IS CHARACTERIZED BY ATAXIA PROGRESSIVE NEUROLOGIC DEGENERATION CUTANEOUS AND CONJUNCTIVAL TELANGIECTASIS AND IMMUNOLOGIC DEFICIENCY ROENTGENOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF CHRONIC PULMONARY AND SINUS INFECTIONS AND DECREASED LYMPHOID TISSUE WILL USUALLY BE PRESENT AS THE SINOPULMONARY ABNORMALITIES RESEMBLE THOSE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS A SMALL ADENOIDAL MASS MAY BE OF DIFFERENTIAL AID
17;CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS NO LONGER RARE IN ADULTS THE LUNG IS THE MAIN TARGET ORGAN AND THE BASIC LESION IS BRONCHIAL OBSTRUCTION LEADING TO BRONCHIECTASIS INTERSTITIAL INFILTRATES AND CYST LIKE CHANGES ARE CHARACTERISTIC ON ROENTGENOGRAPHY COMPLICATIONS INCLUDE PULMONARY HYPERTENSION PNEUMONITIS HEMORRHAGE AND PNEUMOTHORAX LITTLE CORRELATION EXISTS BETWEEN RESPIRATORY TRACT AND PANCREATIC AND GASTROINTESTINAL INVOLVEMENT DESPITE SIMILARITIES IN PATHOGENESIS PULMONARY CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN ADULTS DOES NOT ALWAYS RESEMBLE THE CONDITION IN CHILDREN AND MUST BE DIFFERENTIATED FROM OTHER CHRONIC INTERSTITIAL DISEASES
18;AS FAR AS RABBIT ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGES ARE CONCERNED THE CONCENTRATION OF HOMOZYGOUS CF SERUM USED IN OUR EXPERIMENTS WAS EVEN GREATER THAN THE FOURFOLD CONCENTRATION WHICH BIGGAR AND ASSOCIATES STATE WAS REQUIRED FOR NORMAL PHAGOCYTOSIS INCREASING DILUTIONS OF HOMOZYGOUS CF SERA WITH EITHER HANKS BALANCED SALT SOLUTION OR NORMAL HUMAN SERUM THUS DECREASING ITS CONCENTRATION INCREASED THE CAPACITY OF THE RABBIT ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGES TO PHAGOCYTIZE AND KILL PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS HAD JUST THE OPPOSITE EFFECT SUSPENSION OF RABBIT ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGES IN HUMAN SERUM REDUCED THEIR PHAGOCYTIC ACTIVITY BUT ACTIVITY WAS REDUCED MORE BY HUMAN CF SERUM THAN BY HUMAN NORMAL SERUM THIS IS NOT UNEXPECTED BECAUSE HIGH HUMAN SERUM CONCENTRATIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE TOXIC TO RABBIT ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGES BECAUSE THE INHIBITION OF PHAGOCYTOSIS WAS ABSENT WHEN HOMOZYGOUS CF SERUM MORE THAN HOURS OLD OR PREVIOUSLY HEATED OR FROZEN WAS USED AND BECAUSE OF OUR OBSERVATIONS THAT DILUTION INCREASED MACROPHAGE PHAGOCYTIC ABILITY WE FEEL OUR DATA DEMONSTRATE THE PRESENCE OF A LABILE INHIBITOR RATHER THAN A DEFICIENCY SINCE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT CF PATIENTS HAVE NORMAL OR ELEVATED CONCENTRATIONS OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS INCLUDING IGA IN THEIR SERA AND PULMONARY SECRETIONS AND RESPOND TO INFECTION AND IGA HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO BE ESSENTIAL FOR ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGE PHAGOCYTOSIS OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA WE CANNOT AGREE THAT THIS INHIBITION IS DUE TO AN IGA DEFICIENCY WE ALSO NOTE THAT SOME OF THE SERA USED IN THE EXPERIMENTS OF BIGGAR AND ASSOCIATES WERE STORED AT DEGREES C PERHAPS THIS MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN RESULTS
19;WE ASSAYED THE SERUM OF A GROUP OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS THAT WERE ON ORAL ARGININE THERAPY AND THAT OF A GROUP OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS THAT WERE NOT RECEIVING THIS TREATMENT FOR TOTAL ARGININE ESTERASE ACTIVITY THE UNTREATED CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SERUM ARGININE ESTERASE ACTIVITY THAN THE NORMAL CONTROLS THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS CARRIERS AND THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS RECEIVING ORAL ARGININE THERAPY THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ARGININE ESTERASE ACTIVITY OF THE NORMAL CONTROLS AND THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS CARRIERS OR THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS TREATED WITH ARGININE WE HAVE RECENTLY OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN THE ARGININE ESTERASES IN PLASMA OF CONTROLS AND PATIENTS BY ELECTROFUSING ON POLYACRYLAMIDE GELS SIX ACTIVITY BANDS COULD BE DETECTED IN PLASMA OF CONTROLS WHEREAS ONLY FIVE COULD BE DETECTED IN PLASMA OF PATIENTS OUR WORK ON THE DEFICIENCY OF TRYPSIN LIKE ACTIVITY IN MIXED SALIVA OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAS BEEN REPRODUCED BY ANOTHER LABORATORY COBURN RECENTLY CONFIRMED OUR WORK ON DEFICIENCY OF ARGININE ESTERASE IN SERUM OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AT PRESENT THE DEFICIENCY OF ARGININE ESTERASE IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS A WORKING HYPOTHESIS TO UNDERSTAND THE BASIC DEFECT THE VARIATIONS OF PH AND SODIUM CHLORIDE CONTENT THAT I EMPLOYED HAD BEEN TESTED BY ME IN PATIENTS BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT A DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND WERE FOUND NOT TO ALTER THE LEVEL OF ARGININE ESTERASE ACTIVITY THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO STUDIES RESULTED FROM THE CONTROL SUBJECTS DR RAO NEGLECTS TO MENTION THE FEW OTHER LABORATORIES THAT WERE UNABLE TO CONFIRM HIS FINDINGS
20;THE ABILITY TO DETECT ABNORMALITIES OF LUNG FUNCTION IN CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS BY THE MEASUREMENT OF CLOSING VOLUME WAS STUDIED IN CHILDREN FLOW VOLUME CHARACTERISTICS ROUTINE SPIROMETRY BODY PLETHYSMOGRAPHY AND ARTERIALIZED OXYGEN TENSIONS WERE STUDIED FOR COMPARISON WITH CLOSING VOLUME CLOSING VOLUME WAS LESS SENSITIVE IN DETECTING DISEASE THAN WERE THE RESIDUAL VOLUME TO TOTAL LUNG CAPACITY RATIO MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY FLOW VOLUME CURVES AND ARTERIALIZED BLOOD GASES
21;FIVE PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS DEVELOPED ALLERGIC BRONCHOSPASM AFTER INHALING PANCREATIC EXTRACTS SPRINKLED ON THEIR CHILDREN S FOOD THERE WAS A POSITIVE HISTORY OF ALLERGY BUT NO PAST HISTORY OF ASTHMA IN ANY OF THE PARENTS ASTHMA RESPONDED TO BRONCHODILATORS AND USE OF A FACE MASK DURING PREPARATION OF MEALS PREVENTED RECURRENCES TO DATE ASTHMA PRECIPITATES BY INHALATION OF PANCREATIC EXTRACTS HAS NOT BEEN SEEN IN ANY OF THE PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS
22;AIRWAY RESISTANCE AND LUNG VOLUME WERE MEASURED BY A MODIFICATION OF THE PLETHYSMOGRAPHIC METHOD OF BRISCOE AND DUBOIS TO CALCULATE SPECIFIC AIRWAY RESISTANCE SRAW ON CONTROL SUBJECTS RANGING IN AGE FROM THE NEWBORN TO YEARS THE MEAN SRAW WAS LOWEST IN THE NEWBORN PERIOD AND INCREASED RAPIDLY TO ADULT LEVELS DURING THE FIRST YEARS OF LIFE IN EACH AGE GROUP THE MEAN SRAW WAS LOWER FOR FEMALES THAN IT WAS FOR MALES NO CONTROL SUBJECT HAD AN SRAW GREATER THAN SEC CM H O A DECREASE IN MEAN SRAW FROM SEC CM H O FOR FEMALES TO YEARS OF AGE TO SEC CM H O FOR THOSE OVER YEARS OF AGE PARALLELED SEXUAL MATURATION BUT SIMILAR CHANGES WERE NOT OBSERVED IN THE MALES A DIRECT CORRELATION OF SRAW WITH CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS WAS FOUND IN YOUNG PATIENTS WITH VARIOUS DEGREES OF PULMONARY INVOLVEMENT BECAUSE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS
23;CILIATED NASAL POLYP EPITHELIUM FROM PATIENTS WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WAS MAINTAINED IN ORGAN CULTURE FOR HOURS EXPLANTED EPITHELIUM RETAINED ITS MORPHOLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS AND INCORPORATED SO AND H INTO BLOOD GROUP SPECIFIC GLYCOPROTEINS THAT WERE SECRETED INTO THE MEDIUM THROUGHOUT THE CULTURE PERIOD LABELED MUCOUS GLYCOPROTEIN WAS SOLUBILIZED BY REDUCTION AND ALKYLATION THEN PURIFIED BY GEL FILTRATION CHROMATOGRAPHY PURIFIED GLYCOPROTEIN WAS FURTHER SEPARATED ON DIETHYLAMINOETHYL DEAE CELLULOSE COLUMNS INTO BLOOD GROUP ACTIVE FRACTIONS THESE FRACTIONS HAD SIMILAR AMINO ACID COMPOSITIONS BUT DIFFERED IN N ACETYL NEURAMINIC ACID AND FUCOSE CONTENT AND IN RELATIVE INCORPORATION OF SO AND H GLUCOSAMINE BLOOD GROUP GLYCOPROTEINS FROM POLYP EPITHELIUM OF PATIENTS WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS WERE INDISTINGUISHABLE IN MANY RESPECTS HOWEVER THE SO PER H RATIO OF ALL GLYCOPROTEIN FRACTIONS FROM PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS EXCEEDED THAT OF THE CORRESPONDING FRACTIONS FROM SECRETIONS OF PATIENTS WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS
24;THE PRESSURE VOLUME BEHAVIOR OF THE LUNG WAS STUDIED IN PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ISOVOLUME FLOW PRESSURE RELATIONSHIPS WERE MEASURED IN OF THESE PATIENTS AND A MODIFICATION OF THE FLOW VOLUME TEST WAS EVALUATED FOR DETECTION OF FLOW REDUCTION IN A SEPARATE GROUP OF PATIENTS RELATIVE TO RESULTS IN A CONTROL GROUP OF NORMAL SUBJECTS OF THE PATIENTS HAD GROSSLY ABNORMAL PRESSURE VOLUME CURVES WITH EXCESSIVE STIFFNESS OF THE LUNG NEAR MAXIMUM VOLUME AND LOSS OF RECOIL AT LOWER VOLUME CLOSING VOLUMES IN THESE PATIENTS WERE OFTEN HIGH ENOUGH TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DISTURBANCES IN GAS EXCHANGE AND THE ELEVATED CLOSING VOLUMES WERE QUANTITATIVELY EXPLAINED BY THE LOW VALUES FOR ELASTIC RECOIL THE MODIFIED FLOW VOLUME TEST DETECTED MILD FLOW REDUCTION IN MANY PATIENTS WHO OTHERWISE HAD NORMAL PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS LOSS OF RECOIL PER SE DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE LOW MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY FLOWS SINCE UPSTREAM RESISTANCES WERE HIGH HOWEVER PRESSURE FLOW CURVES WERE EFFORT DEPENDENT AT HIGH LUNG VOLUMES EVEN IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION SHOWING THAT TIME CONSTANTS OF EMPTYING VARIED WIDELY IN THESE PATIENTS IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT DETERIORATION OF LUNG FUNCTION IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS INVOLVES MORE THAN AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION AND THAT THE WORSENING GAS TRAPPING IS EXPLAINED BY A PROGRESSIVE LOSS OF LUNG ELASTIC RECOIL
25;USE OF BLAND AEROSOLS PARTICULARLY MIST TENTS IN THE TREATMENT OF LOWER RESPIRATORY DISEASE WAS REVIEWED AND NO CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF EFFICACY WAS FOUND THIS IS NOT SURPRISING BECAUSE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT MIST TENTS DEPOSIT LITTLE WATER IN THE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT MIST TENTS MAY BE DETRIMENTAL IN SOME CASES BECAUSE OF BACTERIAL CONTAMINATION AND BECAUSE THEY CAN CAUSE BRONCHOSPASM
26;PLASMA ARGININE ESTERASE ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED IN YOUNG ADULT PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND IN CONTROL SUBJECTS THE ENZYME WAS ACTIVATED BY TREATING THE PLASMA WITH CHLOROFORM AND ELLAGIC ACID IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED BY RAO AND ASSOCIATES NO DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND EITHER BETWEEN THE ARGININE ESTERASE ACTIVITIES OF THE PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND THE CONTROL SUBJECTS OR BETWEEN THE DEGREES OF ACTIVITY INHIBITED BY SOYBEAN TRYPSIN INHIBITOR THUS THE FINDINGS OF RAO AND ASSOCIATES OF A DEFICIENCY OF ARGININE ESTERASE ACTIVITY IN THE PLASMA OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WERE NOT CONFIRMED
27;IN SPITE OF THE WIDESPREAD CLINICAL IMPRESSION THAT PULMONARY PHYSICAL THERAPY INCLUDING BREATHING EXERCISES IS HELPFUL IN THE PEDIATRIC AGE GROUP OBJECTIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THE VALUE OF THE VARIOUS MANEUVERS IS FOR THE MOST PART LACKING THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE VOLUME OF SPUTUM PRODUCED OVER SHORT PERIODS OF TIME IN PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS INCREASED WHEN COUGH IS ACCOMPANIED BY POSTURAL DRAINAGE AND PULMONARY PHYSICAL THERAPY BUT THE LONG TERM EFFECT OF THE VARIOUS MANEUVERS ON THE COURSE OF THE CHRONIC PULMONARY DISEASE REMAINS UNKNOWN
28;THE PRESENT STUDY POINTS OUT THE SIMPLICITY AND EASE OF USING FINGERNAILS AND TOENAILS TO MEASURE ELECTROLYTE LEVELS AS A TEST FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS PROCEDURES AND VARIOUS EFFECTS ON THE RANGES OF VALUES FOR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF HEALTHY AND DISEASED SUBJECTS ARE DISCUSSED AND THE LIMITATIONS OF THE METHOD ARE INDICATED
29;AN EAR NOSE THROAT SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT ON CHILDREN AGED TO YEARS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WERE SHOWN TO BE TRANSIENTLY DEAF ASSOCIATED WITH EUSTACHIAN TUBE DYSFUNCTION THERE WERE NO CONFIRMED CASES OF SECRETORY OTITIS MEDIA CHILDREN WERE FOUND TO HAVE NASAL POLYPS OR GAVE A HISTORY OF POLYPECTOMY THOUGH A HIGH INCIDENCE OF MIDDLE EAR PROBLEMS IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE U S A NEITHER DEAFNESS NOR SECRETORY OTITIS MEDIA WAS FOUND TO BE A PROBLEM IN THE GROUP STUDIED
30;PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAVE TOCOPHEROL DEFICIENCY PRESUMABLY AS A RESULT OF STEATORRHOEA EVIDENCE FOR POSSIBLE MUSCULAR INVOLVEMENT IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS IS CLINICAL MUSCULAR WEAKNESS AND WASTING IN MANY PATIENTS BIOCHEMICAL CREATINURIA ON A CREATINE POOR DIET WITH REVERSAL OF THIS FINDING AFTER INGESTION OF TOCOPHEROL ESTERS ACCOMPANIED BY A DECREASE IN CREATINE IN PLASMA AND AN INCREASE IN CREATINE IN MUSCLE AND PATHOLOGICAL FOCAL LESIONS IN SKELETAL MUSCLE RESEMBLING NUTRITIONAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY AND CEROID PIGMENT IN SMOOTH MUSCLE MUSCLE STRENGTH WAS MEASURED WITH A BULB ERGOGRAPH IN PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ATTENDING THE CLINICS AT THE BABIES HOSPITAL COLUMBIA PRESBYTERIAN MEDICAL CENTER NEW YORK IN A DOUBLE BLIND STUDY IN WHICH HALF THE CASES RECEIVED TOCOPHEROL ORALLY AND THE REMAINDER PLACEBO NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MUSCLE STRENGTH WAS FOUND IN THOSE PATIENTS RECEIVING TOCOPHEROL OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS AS COMPARED TO THE PLACEBO GROUP BLOOD TOCOPHEROL LEVELS IN THE TREATED GROUP RETURNED TO NORMAL
31;THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MIST TENT THERAPY DECREASES THE VISCOSITY OF SPUTUM BY DIRECT LIQUEFACTION OF THE SPUTUM IN THE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT WAS TESTED IN PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF THE FIRST NIGHT ALL PATIENTS SLEPT WITHOUT THE MIST TENT AND THE FIRST MORNING SPUTUM WAS COLLECTED FOR ANALYSIS THE FOLLOWING NIGHTS PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO A TENT SUPPLIED BY EITHER A JET OR ULTRASONIC NEBULIZER THE EARLY MORNING SPUTUM WAS ANALYSED FOR VOLUME VISCOSITY WATER CONTENT AND DNA CONTENT AN INDEX OF PURULENCE THERE WAS NO RELATION BETWEEN SPUTUM VISCOSITY AND DNA CONTENT WATER CONTENT OR VOLUME FURTHERMORE THERE WAS NO CONSISTENT RELATION BETWEEN SPUTUM VISCOSITY OR VOLUME EXPECTORATED AND THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF AN HOUR STAY IN THE TENT WITH EITHER METHOD OF WATER NEBULIZATION THESE RESULTS THEREFORE SUGGEST THAT MIST THERAPY DOES NOT CONSISTENTLY INFLUENCE SPUTUM VISCOSITY OR VOLUME IN PATIENTS WITH CF ABOVE A SPUTUM WATER CONTENT OF FURTHER INCREASES IN WATER CONTENT DO NOT INFLUENCE VISCOSITY
32;TWO SISTERS ARE DESCRIBED WITH FATAL CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN THE LUNG CONDITION WAS CLINICALLY AND HISTOLOGICALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND THE SALIVARY GLANDS SHOWED PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES EXPECTED IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS NEITHER CHILD HAD ABNORMAL SWEAT ELECTROLYTES THEY HAD NO BOWEL SYMPTOMS AND THE PANCREAS WAS NORMAL AT NECROPSY
33;CELLULOSE ACETATE STRIP ELECTROPHORESIS WAS FOUND TO BE NOT SUFFICIENTLY RELIABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN NORMAL AND CF MECONIUM BUT MARKED DIFFERENCES WERE OBTAINED WHEN QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOELECTROPHORETIC METHODS WERE EMPLOYED NORMAL MECONIUM WAS SHOWN TO CONTAIN ALPHA ANTITRYPSIN AND ALPHA ANTICHYMOTRYPSIN AND MOST SAMPLES CONTAINED LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF ALBUMIN AND MEASURABLE AMOUNTS OF A VARIETY OF OTHER PLASMA PROTEINS IT IS SUGGESTED THAT QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOELECTROPHORESIS COULD BE USED AS A MEANS OF CONFIRMING THE DIAGNOSIS OF CF IF POSITIVE RESULTS ARE OBTAINED WHEN MECONIUM SPECIMENS ARE SCREENED WITH TEST STRIPS
34;THE COEXISTENCE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND COELIAC DISEASE HAS RECENTLY BEEN REPORTED AND IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT CYSTIC FIBROSIS MAY PREDISPOSE TO THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF COELIAC DISEASE THE DIAGNOSIS OF COELIAC DISEASE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON THE DEMONSTRATION OF HISTOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE SMALL INTESTINE BUT JEJUNAL BIOPSY MAY BE DISTRESSING TO A SMALL CHILD IT IS SUGGESTED THAT FOOD PROTEIN ANTIBODY STUDIES MAY BE OF VALUE IN THE INVESTIGATION OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN WHOM GLUTEN SENSITIVITY IS SUSPECTED IN THE FOLLOWING CASE THE DECISION TO PERFORM A JEJUNAL BIOPSY WAS MADE WHEN THESE STUDIES WERE POSITIVE FOOD PROTEIN ANTIBODY TO CEREAL ANTIGENS WHEAT OATMEAL AND GLUTEN AND TO RUMINANT ANTIGENS COW S MILK AND CALF SERUM WERE PERSISTENTLY DETECTED IN THE PATIENT S BLOOD JEJUNAL BIOPSY SHOWED PARTIAL VILLOUS ATROPHY WITH SHORTENING BROADENING AND BRANCHING OF THE VILLI THERE WAS A SATISFACTORY CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT AFTER GLUTEN RESTRICTION
35;A SIMPLE IMMUNOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUE UTILIZING SINGLE RADIAL IMMUNODIFFUSION FOR THE DEMONSTRATION OF ALBUMIN IN HUMAN MECONIUM IS DESCRIBED A COMPARISON OF THIS TECHNIQUE WITH THE MORE WIDELY USED SULPHOSALICYLIC ACID PRECIPITATION METHOD IS REPORTED WE ALSO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DETERMINE THE NORMAL LEVELS OF ALBUMIN IN MECONIUM
37;NEONATAL PERITONITIS REMAINS A DANGEROUS CONDITION FACTORS COMPLICATING DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT INCLUDE ITS LOW INCIDENCE THE DIVERSITY OF AETIOLOGICAL FACTORS FOUND AND THE SEVERITY OF UNDERLYING OR ASSOCIATED DISEASE CASES PRESENTING SINCE AT SOUTHMEAD GENERAL HOSPITAL WERE REVIEWED THIRTEEN AETIOLOGICAL FACTORS RELATING TO MOTHER OR BABY WERE FOUND INFANTS WERE PREMATURE HAD SEVERE RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS AT BIRTH MATERNAL HYDRAMNIOS WAS PRESENT IN BABIES HAD HAD EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION THE COMMONEST FINDINGS WERE GANGRENOUS VOLVULUS AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS COMBINED FACTORS WERE OFTEN PRESENT THE USUAL PRESENTATION IS WITH BILIOUS VOMITING ABDOMINAL DISTENSION AND FAILURE TO PASS NORMAL MECONIUM CASES HAD DISTENDED ABDOMENS AT BIRTH PLAIN ABDOMINAL X RAYS ARE OF GREAT DIAGNOSTIC VALUE PNEUMOPERITONEUM IS DIAGNOSTIC BUT ABSENT FROM EARLY FILMS TREATMENT IS SURGICAL CLOSE LIAISON WITH THE PAEDIATRICIAN WHO SEES THE BABY FIRST IS ESSENTIAL IN ASSESSING RESULTS IT IS POINTED OUT THAT MANY OF THESE BABIES ARE SMALL AND OR SUFFERING FROM SERIOUS CONDITIONS SUCH AS HAEMOLYTIC DISEASE CYSTIC FIBROSIS OR GANGRENOUS VOLVULUS CASES WERE CONSIDERED UNFIT FOR SURGERY OF SUBMITTED TO SURGERY SURVIVED MOSTLY IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SERIES

80;STUDY OF THE HUMORAL ANTIBODY RESPONSE OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS TO THE HEAT STABLE O AND POSSIBLY K ANTIGENS OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA REVEALED THAT THESE ANTIBODIES IN SIGNIFICANT TITERS DO NOT LEAD TO ERADICATION OF THE MICROORGANISM FROM THE RESPIRATORY TRACT IN THREE OUT OF SIX PATIENTS ANTIBODIES DIRECTED AGAINST THE STRAINS ISOLATED FROM BOTH SPUTUM AND THE LUNGS AT AUTOPSY WERE PRESENT IN ELEVATED TITERS THE ANTIBODY RESPONSE TO P AERUGINOSA IS STRIKINGLY AFFECTED BY THE CONDITION OF THE HOST AND DIFFERS IN PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS OR WITH ONE OR ANOTHER KIND OF MALIGNANCY
81;VARIOUS TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN UTILIZED FOR MEASUREMENT OF ANTIBODIES AGAINST PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA IN GENERAL THE RESULTS OF SUCH MEASUREMENTS TEND TO PARALLEL EACH OTHER BUT THE PRINCIPAL FUNCTIONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST PSEUDOMONAS APPEAR TO BE OPSONINS OF THE IGG AND IGM IMMUNOGLOBULIN CLASSES THESE ANTIBODIES ARE POTENTIATED BY THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM ACTIVATED EITHER THROUGH THE CLASSICAL OR ALTERNATE PATHWAYS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO FATAL INFECTION WITH PSEUDOMONAS IS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIBODY DEFICIENCY BUT THIS DEFECT IS USUALLY CORRELATED WITH OTHER DATA REGARDING THE STATE OF THE HOST SUCH AS UNDERLYING DISEASE IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY AND FUNCTIONAL LEUKOPENIA ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NEEDED ON THE RELATIVE PROTECTIVE ROLE OF IGG AND IGM ANTIBODIES THE AFFINITY OF SUCH ANTIBODIES FOR VIABLE BACTERIA AND THE ROLE OF ANTIBODIES AGAINST NONLIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE ANTIGENS SUCH AS PROTEIN COMPONENTS OF THE CELL WALL AND PSEUDOMONAS EXOTOXINS

90;THE RECENT DATA SUGGEST THAT WE CAN NO LONGER USE MIST TENTS OR INTERMITTENT AEROSOL THERAPY FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS WITH THE ABANDON PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED WE CANNOT ACCEPT SUCH THERAPY AS HAVING BEEN PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE WE FORMERLY BELIEVED AEROSOLS AND MISTS COULD DO LITTLE HARM WE NOW KNOW THEY CAN BE HARMFUL IF SUCH TREATMENT IS TO BE USED THE PATIENT SHOULD BE CLOSELY MONITORED CLINICALLY AND WITH SENSITIVE PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS SUCH AS MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY FLOW VOLUME CURVES IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WE HAVE MUCH MORE TO LEARN CONFIRM OR DISPROVE WITH RESPECT TO THE RATIONALE FOR AND BENEFITS OF MIST AND AEROSOL THERAPY
91;WE HAVE RECENTLY STUDIED AN YEAR OLD CHILD WITH PROVED CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN WHOM RAISED SWEAT SODIUM BUT NORMAL SWEAT CHLORIDE LEVELS WERE OBTAINED WHILE SHE WAS RECEIVING CLOXACILLIN THERE WAS NO PERIPHERAL EDEMA OR HYPOPROTEINEMIA ALTHOUGH AT NECROPSY THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF BILIARY CIRRHOSIS ALTHOUGH THE SWEAT ABNORMALITY MIGHT HAVE BEEN DUE TO AS YET UNKNOWN FACTORS THE TEMPORAL ASSOCIATION WITH CLOXACILLIN ADMINISTRATION SUGGESTS A CAUSATIVE RELATIONSHIP AND IT IS TEMPTING TO SPECULATE THAT THE ANOMALY WAS PRODUCED IN THIS INSTANCE BY THE SUBSTITUTION OF THE CLOXACILLIN RADICAL FOR THE CHLORIDE ION IN THE SWEAT DURING THE PERIOD OF THERAPY IN LIGHT OF OUR FINDINGS IT WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO KNOW WHETHER THE INFANT REPORTED BY MACLEAN AND TRIPP WAS RECEIVING ANY DRUGS AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SWEAT CHLORIDE ESTIMATIONS AND WHETHER SODIUM ESTIMATIONS WERE ALSO PERFORMED
92;PANCREATIC GLUCAGON AND INSULIN WERE DETERMINED IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS C F AND IN A CONTROL GROUP FOLLOWING STIMULATION BY AN ARGININE INFUSION IN CONTROLS THE INFUSION OF ARGININE INDUCED A PROMPT THREEFOLD ELEVATION IN PLASMA PANCREATIC GLUCAGON AND ABOUT A SIXFOLD INCREASE IN PLASMA IMMUNOREACTIVE INSULIN IN PATIENTS WITH C F THE AVERAGE RESPONSE OF BOTH HORMONES WAS CONSIDERABLY LESS AND THE BASE LINE CONCENTRATIONS FOR GLUCAGON WERE LOWER THE DATA SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IN C F BOTH ALPHA AND BETA CELL FUNCTION ARE AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF THE UNDERLYING PROCESS
93;THE EFFICIENCY OF DELIVERY OF AN AEROSOL TO CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AGED MONTHS TO YEARS WAS INVESTIGATED WITH THE USE A STANDARD ULTRASONIC NEBULIZER THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO SIMULATE CLINICAL CONDITIONS AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE RETENTION OF THE AEROSOL WAS MONITORED WITH A SCINTILLATION CAMERA INTERFACED TO A SMALL DIGITAL COMPUTER THE CHILDREN ALSO HAD VENTILATION STUDIES WITH XENON WHICH ALLOWED COMPARISON OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF AEROSOL WITH REGIONAL VENTILATION THE AEROSOL WAS VISUALIZED WITHIN THE LUNGS OF ALL PATIENTS BETWEEN AND PER CENT OF THE INITIAL ACTIVITY WAS DEPOSITED IN THE LUNGS REPRESENTING AN AVERAGE OF ML PER THERAPY SESSION OR ML PER KILOGRAM OF BODY WEIGHT THERE WAS A POSITIVE CORRELATION R P BETWEEN INCREASING AGE AND GREATER PULMONARY DEPOSITION OF THE AEROSOL THERE WAS DECREASED AEROSOL ENTRY TO REGIONS WHICH WERE POORLY VENTILATED THE EFFICIENCY OF AEROSOL DEPOSITION IS VARIABLE IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS DEPENDING PRIMARILY ON THE AGE OF THE PATIENT WHEREAS ITS DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THEIR LUNGS IS RELATED TO REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN THE SEVERITY OF THE PULMONARY DISEASE
94;THE RECENT INTERESTING REPORT ON CYSTIC FIBROSIS WITH EDEMA AND FALSELY NEGATIVE SWEAT TEST PROMPTED US TO REPORT A SIMILAR CASE THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED SIMILAR CASES AND THIS ONE SUGGEST THAT WHEN CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS SUSPECTED IN AN EDEMATOUS INFANT AND THE SWEAT CHLORIDE OR SODIUM CONCENTRATION IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE THE TEST SHOULD BE REPEATED AFTER THE EDEMA HAS DISAPPEARED
95;TWELVE PATIENTS WITH ABDOMINAL COMPLAINTS HAD AN OPERATION THAT INCLUDED INCIDENTAL APPENDECTOMY THEY WERE LATER DIAGNOSED AS HAVING CYSTIC FIBROSIS FOUR GROUPS OF PRESENTING SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS WERE RIGHT LOWER QUADRANT MASS CHRONIC ABDOMINAL PAIN INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION AND HEPATOMEGALY IN ALL CASES THE SYMPTOMS PRECIPITATING OPERATION WERE DUE TO THE UNDERLYING UNRECOGNIZED CONDITION CYSTIC FIBROSIS REVIEW OF THE HISTOLOGY OF THE APPENDIX REVEALED THE CLASSIC CHANGES OF HYPERSECRETION OF THE MUCOUS GLANDS TO BE PRESENT THE APPENDIX SHARES IN THE GENERALIZED INTESTINAL MUCOUS GLAND INVOLVEMENT PECULIAR TO CYSTIC FIBROSIS AWARENESS OF THIS FACT HAS NOT BEEN WIDESPREAD PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THE USUAL EMPHASIS ON THE PULMONARY AND PANCREATIC ASPECTS OF THE DISEASE GREATER APPRECIATION OF THE CLINICAL SYMPTOMS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND MORE LIBERAL USE OF THE SWEAT TEST COULD HAVE DIMINISHED THE NUMBER OF EXPLORATORY CELIOTOMIES RECOGNITION OF THE HISTOLOC CHANGES IN THE REMOVED APPENDICES CAN ALSO SUGGEST THE PROPER DIAGNOSIS AND LEAD TO EARLIER INSTITUTION OF TREATMENT WITH AN IMPROVED PROGNOSIS

272;IN THIS STUDY WE HAVE COMPARED TWO GROUPS OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ONE GROUP OF CF CHILDREN HAD SEVERE MALNUTRITION IN THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE WHEREAS THE SECOND GROUP OF CF CHILDREN HAD NOT BEEN MALNOURISHED THE CATCH UP GROWTH EXPERIENCED BY BOTH THE CONTROL AND MALNOURISHED GROUPS WAS IMPRESSIVE AND WAS GENERALLY COMPLETE IN TERMS OF HEIGHT AND WEIGHT FOR AGE THIS FINDING IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER REPORTS REGARDING CATCH UP GROWTH FOLLOWING MALNUTRITION ASSOCIATED WITH CELIAC DISEASE ANOREXIA NERVOSA RENAL ACIDOSIS CUSHING SYNDROME AND HYPOTHYROIDISM THOUGH THE MALNOURISHED GROUP TENDED TO HAVE LOWER IQ AND SCHOOL PERFORMANCE SCORES THE DIFFERENCES WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EXCEPT FOR BACKWARD DIGIT SPAN THAT DIFFERENCE MAY INDICATE AN ORGANIC IMPAIRMENT DUE TO MALNUTRITION OR TO ANY OF SEVERAL OTHER FACTORS OUR DATA FAIL TO DEMONSTRATE ANY PERMANENT OR DEVASTATING EFFECT OF EARLY MALNUTRITION DURING A VERY RAPID GROWTH PHASE ON THE SUBSEQUENT GROWTH IQ AND SCHOOL PERFORMANCE IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS STUDIED AT AGE TO YEARS
273;THE ABSORPTION OF DIGOXIN IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS WAS EVALUATED IN SUBJECTS BY ASSESSING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOSAGE EXPRESSED IN MUG KG DAY AND SERUM DIGOXIN CONCENTRATION THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE SAME RELATIONSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN MAINTENANCE DOSAGE AND SERUM LEVELS IN THESE PATIENTS AND IN PATIENTS WITHOUT CYSTIC FIBROSIS THUS NO EVIDENCE OF IMPAIRED ABSORPTION WAS FOUND
274;AN ABSENT VAS DEFERENS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH UNILATERAL RENAL AGENESIS OR UNDIAGNOSED CYSTIC FIBROSIS SUCH PATIENTS SHOULD BE FURTHER EVALUATED WITH A SWEAT CHLORIDE AND INTRAVENOUS PYELOGRAM THE FINDING OF ABSENT VAS DEFERENS DURING EXPLORATION FOR AN UNDESCENDED TESTIS DOES NOT PROVIDE ABSOLUTE EVIDENCE FOR ABSENCE OF THE TESTIS SINCE THESE STRUCTURES HAVE INDEPENDENT EMBRYOLOGIC ORIGINS
275;THE DIAMETERS OF CIRCULATING PERIPHERAL LYMPHOCYTES WERE MEASURED IN CHILDREN WITH JUVENILE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS THESE WERE COMPARED WITH LYMPHOCYTE MEASUREMENTS IN NORMAL CHILDREN CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA AND CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS THE AVERAGE DIAMETER OF LYMPHOCYTES IN NORMAL CHILDREN WAS FOUND TO BE MICRONS IN CONTRAST THE AVERAGE DIAMETER OF LYMPHOCYTES IN JUVENILE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WAS MICRONS P LESS THAN THERE WERE MORE LYMPHOCYTES WITH A DIAMETER OF TO MICRONS IN CHILDREN WITH JUVENILE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS THAN IN NORMAL CHILDREN

281;MR STUART AND DR BURDON SPECULATE ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE HIGH FREQUENCY OF THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS GENE AMONG CAUCASIANS MAY BE DUE TO THE HETEROZYGOTES HAVING SOME ADVANTAGE IN BIOLOGICAL FITNESS OVER NORMAL HOMOZYGOTES THEY SUGGEST THAT THIS MIGHT BE DUE TO INCREASED RESISTANCE TO TYPHUS ONCE ENDEMIC IN EUROPE ON THE BASIS OF THE WELL KNOWN IMMUNOLOGICAL CROSS REACTIVITY BETWEEN THE CAUSATIVE ORGANISM RICKETTSIA PROWAZEKI AND CERTAIN STRAINS OF THE SPECIES PROTEUS VULGARIS WHICH IS AGGLUTINATED BY SERA FROM CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS AND HETEROZYGOTES HOWEVER THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS AGGLUTINATION IS AN IMMUNOLOGICAL REACTION IT APPEARS MICROSCOPICALLY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH DISORGANISATION AND INHIBITION OF THE BACTERIAL FLAGELLAE LEADING TO CLUMPING OF THE ORGANISMS AS SUCH IT IS PROBABLY ANALOGOUS TO THE EFFECT ON CILIA OF RABBIT TRACHEA AND OYSTER OR MUSSEL GILLS THE CILIA FACTOR ALTHOUGH ASSOCIATED WITH IGG IS NOW KNOWN NOT TO BE IGG ITSELF AND MAY WELL BE THE C A COMPONENT OF COMPLEMENT THESE AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS SUCH AS THOSE ON SALIVARY AND SWEAT GLAND SECRETIONS AND ON SODIUM FLUX SUGGEST THAT ALL THESE PHENOMENA ARE MEMBRANE RATHER THAN IMMUNOLOGICAL EFFECTS ALTHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A PROTEUS FLAGELLA ANTIGEN COULD ALSO BE THE BINDING SITE FOR THE CILIA FACTOR THIS SEEMS IMPROBABLE AN ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT HETEROZYGOTES FOR THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS GENE HAVE INCREASED RESISTANCE TO TUBERCULOSIS THIS WOULD MEET THE REQUIREMENT OF A COMMON DISEASE RECENTLY ENDEMIC IN EUROPE AT LEAST AS WELL AS TYPHUS AND IS SUGGESTED BY INDIRECT EVIDENCE FROM A FAMILY STUDY DEMONSTRATING A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER INCIDENCE OF TUBERCULOSIS AMONG THE PARENTS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS THAN AMONG PARENTS OF CONTROLS
282;FEW ANTIBIOTICS HAVE THERAPEUTIC VALUE AGAINST PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA AND EACH OF THEM HAS SHORTCOMINGS IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO TRY AND PREVENT PSEUDOMONAS INFECTION IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE BURNS IMMUNODEFICIENCY CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND OTHER CONDITIONS OR METHODS OF TREATMENT THAT MAKE THEM PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO INVASION BY THESE BACTERIA
283;THE NATURE OF THE METABOLIC DEFECT IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS C F IS UNKNOWN WE THEREFORE UNDERTOOK TO STUDY FATTY ACID OXIDATION BETA OXIDATION IN PATIENTS WITH C F THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN CONTROLS AND EITHER AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS OR HETEROZYGOUS CARRIERS ALL THE VALUES IN THE AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS LAY WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE UNLESS FOR SOME SPECIAL REASON THE DEFECT IS NOT EXPRESSED IN LEUKOCYTES THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE METABOLIC PATHWAY INVOLVED IN FATTY ACID OXIDATION BETA OXIDATION IS INTACT IN C F IT THEREFORE SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THE REPORTED DEFICIENCY OF CERTAIN ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS IN C F IS THE RESULT OF A DEFECT IN FATTY ACID METABOLISM
284;WE BELIEVE THAT SERUM LEVELS OF INDIVIDUAL COMPLEMENT COMPONENTS IN CHILDREN CANNOT BE MEANINGFULLY INTERPRETED UNLESS THEY ARE COMPARED WITH NORMAL VALUES OBTAINED FROM AGE MATCHED CONTROLS IN A STUDY OF HEALTHY INFANTS AND CHILDREN WE FOUND A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION OF C LEVELS WITH AGE BUT NOT WITH SEX OR RACE AND WE ALSO FOUND A WIDE RANGE OF VALUES WITHIN ANY GIVEN AGE GROUP IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS REPORTS WE DID NOT FIND RAISED C LEVELS IN THE MAJORITY OF OUR C F PATIENTS WHEN THE VALUES WERE COMPARED WITH PROJECTED GROUP MEAN VALUES FOR THE APPROPRIATE AGE AND WE DID NOT FIND A SIGNIFICANT ELEVATION OF THE MEAN C LEVEL FOR THE C F PATIENTS IN ANY OF THE AGE GROUPS TESTED

286;PATIENTS WITH PROVEN CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND A WIDE VARIETY OF SCHWACHMAN CLINICAL SCORES WERE STUDIED AND THE CONTROLS WERE HEALTHY CHILDREN UNDERGOING MINOR ELECTIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FOR CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS THERE ARE NOT ONLY DECREASED PROPORTIONS OF ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS BUT THAT OMEGA IS FOUND IN ALL CASES OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE IS NO INTRINSIC DEFECT OF THE DESATURATING SYSTEM IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND THAT THE PATTERN OF ESSENTIAL FATTY ACID DEFICIENCY IS ENTIRELY SIMILAR TO THAT FOUND IN DIETARY DEFICIENCY OF ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS A FURTHER SIGNIFICANT FINDING IS THE OCCURANCE IF OMEGA IN APPARENTLY HEALTHY CHILDREN PARTICULARLY THE VERY YOUNG THIS IS PROBABLY DIET RELATED AND EMPHASISES THE YOUNG CHILD S VERY LARGE REQUIREMENT FOR ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS FOR MEMBRANE SYNTHESIS THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS IN CHILDHOOD CANNOT BE OVERSTATED WHETHER THEY BE FOR NORMAL MEMBRANE SYNTHESIS OR LOWERING OF SERUM LIPIDS GIVING POSSIBLE PROTECTION AGAINST CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
287;IN THREE LITERATURE REPORTS THE LINOLEIC ACID L A LEVELS FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS C F COMPARED TO CONTROLS ARE ALWAYS MORE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN ARACHIDONIC ACID A A SIMILARLY THE PERCENTAGE LOWERING IS ALSO MORE FOR L A THAN A A THERE IS THUS NO OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE FOR A BLOCKED OR ABSENT DESATURASE AND THE CAUSE OF THE E F A DEFICIENCY MUST BE ELSEWHERE WE HAVE FOUND UP TO OF THE TOTAL FATTY ACIDS IN BOTH SERUM AND RED CELLS TO BE C OMEGA ALL OF OUR C F PATIENTS HAVE SHOWN THIS ACID AT SOME STAGE AND FOR MOST IT IS A PERMANENT FEATURE OF THEIR FATTY ACID PROFILE IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT C OMEGA WOULD PROBABLY ACT AS AN INHIBITOR OF PROSTAGLANDIN FORMATION FROM A A AND IT IS INTERESTING TO CONJECTURE ON WHETHER THIS COULD ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF C F C OMEGA WOULD ALSO BE INCORPORATED INTO P I AND COULD THEN ALTER MEMBRANE PROPERTIES
288;IN AN INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF INTESTINAL MALABSORPTION ON PLASMA LIPIDS WE COMPARED THE FATTY ACID COMPOSITION OF THE SERUM LECITHIN OF PATIENTS WITH MALABSORPTION FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CAUSES AND FOUND SIMILAR CHANGES IRRESPECTIVE OF THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THE MALABSORPTION THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS WAS THAT CLASSICAL E F A DEFICIENCY WAS FOUND ONLY IN PATIENTS WHOSE MALABSORPTION WAS DUE TO MASSIVE SMALL BOWEL RESECTION ALL OTHER CAUSES OF MALABSORPTION GAVE RISE TO CHANGES IDENTICAL TO THOSE FOUND BY OTHER WORKERS IN C F THERE IS THUS NO REASON TO POSTULATE AN ADDITIONAL METABOLIC ABNORMALITY SPECIFIC TO C F THE RELATIVELY NORMAL AMOUNTS OF ARACHIDONIC ACID REPORTED IN SOME E F A DEFICIENT PATIENTS MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY DUE TO ARACHIDONIC ACID
289;SAMUELS AND ELLIOTT HAVE DESCRIBED A NEW TECHNIQUE FOR DETECTING CYSTIC FIBROSIS C F AND THE HETEROZYGOTE FOR C F WE HAVE TESTED THIS TECHNIQUE IN DETAIL ON A SMALLER NUMBER OF PATIENTS ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES TESTED IN OUR STUDY IS SMALL RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THIS TECHNIQUE IS NOT LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN DETECTION OF HETEROZYGOTES FOR C F
290;MR RIVERS AND MR HASSAM PROPOSE THAT THE SUBNORMAL LEVELS OF LINOLEIC ACID FOUND IN THE PLASMA PHOSPHOLIPIDS OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ARE DUE TO MALABSORPTION TO SUBSTANTIATE THEIR HYPOTHESIS THEY DEDUCE THAT THE REMARKABLE REMISSION OBSERVED IN A CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENT GIVEN INTRAVENOUS INTRALIPID WAS DUE NOT TO THE CONTENT OF THE TRIGLYCERIDE COMPONENT OF THE FAT EMULSION BUT TO THE CONTENT OF ITS PHOSPHOLIPID COMPONENT NOT AS THEY STATE THIS EXPLANATION SEEMS UNLIKELY IN VIEW OF THE RELATIVELY SMALL PROPORTION OF IN INTRALIPID PHOSPHOLIPID ESPECIALLY SINCE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF INTRALIPID PHOSPHOLIPID TO HEALTHY SUBJECTS DECREASES BOTH THE AND CONTENT OF THEIR PLASMA PHOSPHOLIPIDS COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTS OF COMPLETE INTRALIPID VERSUS INTRALIPID PHOSPHOLIPID ON THE LEVEL OF IN THE PLASMA PHOSPHOLIPIDS OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WOULD SOON DETERMINE WHETHER THEY LACK THE ABILITY TO DESATURATE TO

323;EXAMINED IN THIS STUDY ARE THE RESULTS OF SIX TESTS OF PULMONARY FUNCTION IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING AND FOLLOWING BRONCHIAL DRAINAGE IN TWENTY SIX PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES AVERAGING AND PERCENT OCCURRED IN PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY EXPIRATORY RESERVE VOLUME AND INSPIRATORY CAPACITY RESPECTIVELY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY AND INSPIRATORY CAPACITY WERE OBSERVED IN A SUBGROUP OF SIX OF THE ABOVE PATIENTS WHO HAD EVIDENCE OF BRONCHOSPASM THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT BRONCHIAL DRAINAGE WILL PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN ROUTINE PULMONARY FUNCTION VALUES THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THIS TREATMENT IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN CLEARING THE LARGER MORE PROXIMAL AIRWAYS AND IS OF BENEFIT EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF CLINICAL BRONCHOSPASM
324;PSYCHOPHYSICAL EXPERIMENTS MEASURED BOTH OLFACTORY SENSITIVITY TO BUTANOL AND SODIUM CHLORIDE AND TASTE SENSITIVITY TO SODIUM CHLORIDE IN NORMAL CHILDREN AND IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS THE SENSITIVITY OF THE CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS FELL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE THESE RESULTS STAND IN CONTRAST TO THOSE OF HENKIN AND POWELL WHO FOUND CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS TO BE HYPERSENSITIVE TO BOTH OLFACTORY AND TASTE STIMULI APPARENT HYPERSENSITIVITY TO TASTE STIMULI COULD HAVE RESULTED FROM THE ADAPTING EFFECTS OF THE RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL OF SODIUM IN THE SALIVA OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS IF THE CONTAMINATING EFFECTS OF SALIVA ARE REMOVED CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS YIELD ON THE AVERAGE A TASTE THRESHOLD IDENTICAL TO THAT OF NORMAL CHILDREN THERE APPEARS TO BE NO SIMPLE EXPLANATION FOR WHY HENKIN AND POWELL FOUND HYPERSENSITIVITY TO ODORANTS THE PRESENT RESULTS INDICATE THAT IN FACT CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS DISPLAY A SLIGHT HYPOSENSITIVITY TO ODORANTS
325;THE SEARCH FOR THE BASIC DEFECT IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAS SO FAR BEEN SINGULARLY DISAPPOINTING THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT IS A DISEASE RECESSIVELY INHERITED IE THAT THE PARENTS CARRY THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS GENE WITHOUT SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF ILL HEALTH HETEROZYGOUS BUT WHEN TRANSMITTED FROM BOTH OF THEM TO AN OFFSPRING THIS CHILD MANIFESTS THE DISEASE HAVING ACQUIRED THE ABNORMAL GENE IN DOUBLE DOSE HOMOZYGOTE CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS THE MOST COMMON OF THE GENETICALLY DETERMINED DISEASES TWO TYPES OF CULTURED CELLS FIBROBLASTS AND WHITE CELLS FROM AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS AND HETEROZYGOUS CARRIERS FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS SHOWED CHARACTERISTIC CHANGES OF METACHROMASIA THAT SEEMED TO ALLOW FOR A CLASSIFICATION OF PATIENTS AND CARRIERS TO BE DISTRIBUTED INTO SEPARATE CLASSES SERUM FROM PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS OF THE PANCREAS DISORGANISES THE MOVEMENT OF CILIA OF THE ISOLATED RABBIT TRACHEAL MUCOSA ONE OF THE EARLY AND ALSO MOST CONSTANT OBSERVATIONS IS THE VISCOSITY OF SECRETIONS OF THE MUCOSAL GLANDS IN THE RESPIRATORY TRACT IN THE ALIMENTARY APPARATUS IN THE BILIARY SYSTEM AND IN THE PANCREAS A STRIKING INCREASE IN THE LEVELS OF SODIUM AND CHLORIDE AND TO A LESSER EXTENT OF POTASSIUM IS PRESENT IN THE SWEAT OF PRACTICALLY ALL SUFFERERS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS HOWEVER FRUSTRATING AND TANTALISING THE OUTCOME OF RESEARCH INTO THE BASIC DEFECT HAS BEEN SO FAR THE ULTIMATE ANSWER IS LIKELY TO BE ASTONISHING IN IT SIMPLICITY
326;INHALATION THERAPY CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO TYPES INTERMITTENT AEROSOL THERAPY WHICH IS USED TO ADMINISTER MEDICATIONS OVER BRIEF PERIODS AND MIST TENT THERAPY WHICH IS USED FOR PROLONGED PERIODS OF TREATMENT THE PRESENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE BASIC DEFECT OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HARD AND FAST GUIDE LINES FOR THE USE OF INHALATION THERAPY MUCH DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PHYSICIAN AND THE DEGREE OF PULMONARY INVOLVEMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT RESPONSE TO BRONCHODILATORS CAN BE ASSESSED RELATIVELY EASILY ASSESSMENT OF MUCOLYTICS AND ANTIBIOTICS IS DIFFICULT ANTIBIOTICS CAN BE USEFUL IN HELPING TO CLEAR INFECTION IN THOSE PATIENTS WITH EARLY DISEASE AS JUDGED BY CLEARING OF PATHOGENS FROM THE COUGH SWAB OR SPUTUM IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC COUGH AND LARGE VOLUMES IF PURULENT SPUTUM WITH POSITIVE CULTURE FROM GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA THE CULTURES NEVER BECOME NEGATIVE AND ONLY IN THE OCCASIONAL PATIENT CAN DEFINITE CLINICAL BENEFIT BE CLAIMED A FEW SEVERELY ILL PATIENTS HAVE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED WHEN THIS THERAPY HAS BEEN INTRODUCED AND THE PATIENTS ARE CONVINCED OF THE BENEFIT OF THIS TREATMENT IT IS OF COURSE IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS DISEASE WITH SUCH A VARYING CLINICAL COURSE TO PROVE SCIENTIFICALLY THAT THE INHALATION THERAPY WAS THE REASON FOR THIS IMPROVEMENT
327;PHYSIOTHERAPY FOR ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS CONTINUED ALONG THE SAME LINES AS FOR YOUNGER PATIENTS BUT CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS MAY BE NECESSARY TO FIT IN WITH THEIR CHANGING NEEDS WHEN PATIENTS ARE TRANSFERRED FROM THE CARE OF THE PAEDIATRICIAN TO THE THORACIC PHYSICIAN IT MAY BE HELPFUL FOR THEM TO BE ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL FOR REASSESSMENT DURING THIS ADMISSION THE OPPORTUNITY CAN BE TAKEN TO REVIEW THE DAILY PHYSIOTHERAPY REGIMEN WITH THE PATIENTS AND THEIR PARENTS POSTURAL DRAINAGE THE USE OF AEROSOLS BREATHING EXERCISES LONG TERM FOLLOW UP COMPLICATIONS HAEMOPTYSIS AND SPONTANEOUS PNEUMOTHORAX THE USE OF INTERMITTENT POSITIVE PRESSURE BREATHING AND TERMINAL CARE ARE DISCUSSED
328;CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS A GENETICALLY DETERMINED DISORDER THE EVIDENCE THAT CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS INHERITED IN THIS WAY COMES FROM SEVERAL SOURCES THE BIRTH FREQUENCY OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH IN BRITAIN FOR SUCH A SERIOUS ILLNESS IT IS EASY TO CALCULATE THE PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION WHO ARE CARRIERS FROM THE BIRTH FREQUENCY OF THE DISEASE THE EXPLANATION OF THE UNLIKELY HIGH BIRTH FREQUENCY OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN EUROPE IS NOT KNOWN AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE SUBSTANTIALLY THE BIRTH FREQUENCY OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS WILL BECOME POSSIBLE ONCE IT IS PRACTICABLE TO DETECT RELIABLY THE CARRIER OF THE GENE
330;THE IMPORTANCE OF REGULAR EFFICIENT POSTURAL DRAINAGE CANNOT BE EMPHASISED TOO STRONGLY MOST PARENTS OF PRE SCHOOL AND PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE PHYSICALLY ABLE TO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THE ROUTINE PHYSIOTHERAPY TREATMENT THE PARENTS WILL REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE PHYSIOTHERAPIST WHO MUST BE READY TO ORGANISE PROFESSIONAL PHYSIOTHERAPY AT CRISIS TIMES IN THE FAMILY AS WELL AS IN THE EVENT OF AN EXACERBATION
331;THE MANIFESTATIONS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS MAKE IT A COMPLEX DISEASE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF WHICH THE RESPIRATORY PHYSICIAN THE MICROBIOLOGIST THE GASTROENTEROLOGIST AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE PSYCHOLOGIST ALL ARE OR SHOULD BE INVOLVED ABOUT IN BABIES WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ARE BORN WITH ACUTE INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION DUE TO PLUGGING OF THE SMALL INTESTINE WITH VERY STICKY MECONIUM DIAGNOSIS IS MADE BY THE TEST FOR EXCESS SALT IN THE SWEAT AND ALTHOUGH POSSIBLE VERY SOON AFTER BIRTH IT IS EASIER TO CARRY OUT AT ABOUT THREE WEEKS OF AGE WHEN THE BABY SWEATS MORE FREELY THE GREAT MAJORITY OF CHILDREN IF NOT TREATED TEND TO SUFFER PROGRESSIVELY MORE FREQUENT CHEST INFECTIONS OR CHRONIC CHEST INFECTIONS THE REASON FOR THE TENDENCY OF THE LUNGS OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS TO BECOME COLONISED BY HARMFUL BACTERIA IS NOT KNOWN MOST CYSTIC FIBROSIS CHILDREN ABSORB CARBOHYDRATE NORMALLY BUT ONLY ABOUT RANGE TO OF THE PROTEIN AND FATS THEY EAT THE ONLY OTHER MAJOR PROBLEM FOR WHICH ANY ACTIVE MEASURES MAY BE REQUIRED IS THE OCCURRENCE OF FIBROSIS OF THE LIVER IN ABOUT OF THESE CHILDREN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP FROM THE BEGINNING TO BE LIKE OTHER CHILDREN
332;WITH IMPROVEMENT IN THE TREATMENT OF CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE SURVIVAL TO ABOUT YEARS OF AGE MANY MORE PATIENTS WITH THIS DISEASE ARE NOW COMING UNDER THE CARE OF THORACIC PHYSICIANS IN NEARLY EVERY PATIENT BRONCHO PULMONARY DISEASE IS THE MAJOR PROBLEM PNEUMOTHORAX IS ENCOUNTERED IN ABOUT OF THE OLDER PATIENTS AND SOME OF THESE OCCUR BILATERALLY A FEW PATIENTS DEVELOP REFRACTORY AIRWAYS OBSTRUCTION AND THEN A TRIAL OF STEROIDS IS JUSTIFIABLE MOST PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ALSO REQUIRE TREATMENT FOR THEIR PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY DIABETES MELLITUS IS MORE COMMON IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS THAN IN THE NORMAL POPULATION ANALYSIS OF SWEAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR DIAGNOSIS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESSES IMPOSED UPON PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE VERY GREAT
333;CYSTIC FIBROSIS FIBROCYSTIC DISEASE OF THE PANCREAS IS A COMMON INHERITED DISEASE WHICH TO DATE STILL HAS A FATAL OUTCOME THE DIVERSITY OF CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS HAS ADDED FURTHER TO THE MYSTERIOUS NATURE OF THE DISEASE AS HAVE THE TANTALIZINGLY CONFLICTING RESULTS OF BIOCHEMICAL PHYSICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES IN MANY LABORATORIES OF THE WESTERN WORLD ONE OF THE MOST CONSTANT CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS IS THE VISCOSITY OF THE SECRETION OF THE MUCOSAL GLANDS IN THE RESPIRATORY AND ALIMENTARY TRACTS IN THE DUCTS OF THE BILIARY SYSTEM AND IN THE PANCREAS IN APPROXIMATELY TO PER CENT OF ALL PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS OF THE PANCREAS THE EARLIEST MANIFESTATION MECONIUM ILEUS OCCURS IN THE NEONATAL PERIOD IN THE REMAINING TO PER CENT OF AFFECTED INFANTS THE SYMPTOMS GENERALLY BECOME EVIDENT WITHIN THE COURSE OF THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE THE LUNG SYMPTOMS TEND TO DOMINATE THE CLINICAL PICTURE IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF UNTREATED PATIENTS AND WILL ULTIMATELY DECIDE THE OUTCOME THE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT IS NOT THE ONLY PART INVOLVED NASAL POLYPS AND THE ACCUMULATION OF VISCOUS SECRETIONS IN THE PARANASAL SINUSES WITH SUBSEQUENT BACTERIAL INFECTION ARE NOT UNUSUAL PANCREATIC DEFICIENCY IS PRESENT IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND CONSISTS OF A GROSS REDUCTION OR COMPLETE ABSENCE OF EXOCRINE SECRETION ALTHOUGH SOME HISTOLOGICAL DAMAGE HAS BEEN SEEN IN THE NEONATAL PERIOD IN INFANTS SUFFERING FROM MECONIUM ILEUS IN GENERAL THE FULL BLOWN PICTURE OF EXTENSIVE CIRRHOSIS WITH PORTAL HYPERTENSION HEPATOSPLENOMEGALY AND SEVERE AND SOMETIMES FATAL HAEMORRHAGES FROM OESOPHAGEAL VARICES IS SEEN IN THE OLDER CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SCREENING OF THE NEWBORN TO ENABLE THE INSTITUTION OF PROTECTIVE MEASURES BEFORE LUNG COMPLICATIONS ARISE HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED WITH VARIOUS TECHNIQUES MANAGEMENT INCLUDES DIET AND PANCREATIC ENZYME REPLACEMENT THE TREATMENT OF PULMONARY DISEASE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF CARE IN PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND ITS PREVENTION IS PRIORITY NUMBER ONE IN THE OVER ALL MANAGEMENT THE OUTLOOK FOR THE CHILD BORN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS DEPENDS TO A LARGE EXTENT UPON THE AVOIDANCE OR DELAY UNTIL ADULT LIFE OF THE TWO COMPLICATIONS THAT THREATEN HIS EXISTENCE COR PULMONALE AND CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER
334;AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF SCREENING FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF DISEASE IN GREAT BRITAIN TODAY THE ORGANISATION OF SCREENING PROGRAMMES PROVIDED NATIONALLY FOR THE WHOLE POPULATION IS DESCRIBED THESE INCLUDE PROGRAMMES FOR PRENATAL CARE SCREENING OF INFANTS SCREENING OF SCHOOLCHILDREN AND SCREENING OF WOMEN FOR CARCINOMA IN SITU OF THE UTERINE CERVIX SELECTIVE SCREENING PROGRAMMES FOR TUBERCULOSIS AND FOR VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL DISEASES ARE MENTIONED EXPERIENCE IN PROVISION OF THESE SERVICES ON A NATIONAL SCALE HAS EMPHASISED THE IMPORTANCE OF EVALUATING FUTURE SCREENING PROGRAMMES BEFORE THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED BY RESEARCH STUDIES ON THEIR EFFECTIVENESS THEIR POSSIBLY HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS AND THEIR COST EVIDENCE FROM RESEARCH IN SCREENING FOR A NUMBER OF DISEASES IS VERY BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED AND IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THERE MAY BE SOME DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMMES FOR THE EARLY DETECTION AND TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION AND OF BREAST CANCER BUT FOR OTHER DISEASES AND FOR MULTIPHASIC SCREENING EVIDENCE SO FAR AVAILABLE IS INSUFFICIENT TO WARRANT ANY IMMEDIATE EXTENSION FROM RESEARCH TOWARDS SERVICE
335;THE STUDIES WERE CARRIED OUT WITH VIEW TO EVALUATE DEVELOPMENT OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS BIOSYNTHESIS IN CHILDREN FROM BIRTH THROUGH FIRST YEAR OF LIFE AND UP TO AGE OF YEARS AS WELL AS TO ESTABLISH THE NORMAL VALUES OF EACH IMMUNOGLOBULIN CLASS IN HEALTHY CHILDREN OF DIFFERENT AGE IN OUR CONDITIONS OF INVESTIGATIONS AND IN OUR GEOGRAFICAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMICAL SITUATION THERE WAS ALSO UNDER CONSIDERATION THE EVALUATION OF BODY REACTION ON ANTIGENIC STIMULATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF GAMMAGLOBULIN PREPARATIONS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE MORE BROADLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE HUMORAL IMMUNITY PARAMETERS IN CHILDREN QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INVESTIGATIONS OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS WERE UNDERTAKEN ALSO IN SAME CHOSEN ILLNESSES WHERE CHANGES IN BIOSYNTHESIS AND METABOLISM OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS MAY BE CONNECTED WITH PATHOGENESIS OF ILLNESS OR WITH TYPE OF TREATMENT CYSTIC FIBROSIS C F ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA SYNDROME A T PITUITARY DWARFISM FENYLOKETONURIA PKU IN SOME GROUPS OF CHILDREN INVESTIGATIONS WERE SYSTEMATICALLY REPEATED TO EVALUATE THE DYNAMISM OF CHANGES
336;PROLIFERATION RATES AND CELLULAR PROTEIN CONTENT HAVE BEEN MEASURED IN CULTURED FIBROBLASTS DERIVED FROM THE SKIN OF NORMAL VOLUNTEERS AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS THREE METHODS OF MEASURING GROWTH INDICATED THAT UNDER OUR CONDITIONS CF FIBROBLASTS DIVIDE NORMALLY WITH A MEAN DOUBLING TIME OF HR DURING THE LOGARITHMIC GROWTH PHASE HOWEVER LOWER CELL PROTEIN DNA RATIOS WERE OBSERVED CONSISTENTLY IN CF CULTURES THIS DIFFERENCE WAS NOT PRESENT IN CONTACT INHIBITED CONFLUENT FIBROBLASTS THE FINDING OF AN APPARENT REDUCTION IN PROTEIN SYNTHESIS DURING RAPID DIVISION COUPLED WITH AN OBSERVATION BY OTHERS THAT CF FIBROBLASTS FAIL TO NORMALLY INDUCE COLLAGEN FORMATION SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A DISTURBANCE IN THE BIOCHEMICAL REGULATION OF PROTEIN SYNTHESIS
337;INSULIN AND ITS VEHICLE WITHOUT INSULIN WERE ADMINISTERED SEPARATELY BY IONTOPHORESIS TO PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF OBLIGATE HETEROZYGOTES AND HEALTHY CONTROLS THE RESULTANT SWEAT CHLORIDE CONCENTRATION AFTER TREATMENT WITH BOTH PREPARATIONS WAS COMPARED IN EACH INDIVIDUAL NO DIFFERENCE AFTER THE TWO TREATMENTS WAS FOUND IN THE CONTROL SAMPLE A DECREASE IN SWEAT CHLORIDE CONCENTRATION AFTER INSULIN IONTOPHORESIS IN COMPARISON WITH THE VEHICLE WAS OBSERVED IN BOTH THE CF P SMALLER THAN AND HETEROZYGOTE P SMALLER THAN SAMPLES THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST AN INVOLVEMENT OF INSULIN IN CF AND A POSSIBLE ROLE OF INSULIN IN SWEAT GLAND FUNCTION
338;PGE INHIBITED ADP INDUCED PLATELET AGGREGATION IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND THEIR PARENTS TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT THAN IN NORMAL CONTROLS WE SUGGEST THAT THIS MAY BE A RELIABLE TEST FOR HETEROZYGOTE CARRIERS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS
339;FATTY INFILTRATION OF THE LIVER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED ROENTGENOGRAPHICALLY IN SEVERAL YOUNG CHILDREN AWARENESS OF THIS POSSIBILITY WILL SOMETIMES ALLOW A RADIOLOGIST TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PATIENT S METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL STATE IF A CHILD S LIVER IS SHOWN TO BE ABNORMALLY RADIOLUCENT CYSTIC FIBROSIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
340;MASSIVE HEMOPTYSIS IS A POTENTIALLY FATAL COMPLICATION OF LONG STANDING CYSTIC FIBROSIS LOBECTOMY MAY PREVENT A HEMORRHAGIC DEATH IF THE HEMORRHAGE SOURCE CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND IF INVOLVEMENT OF THE REMAINING LUNG TISSUE IS MILD SELECTIVE BRONCHIAL ARTERIOGRAPHY WAS PERFORMED IN SIX PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS TO LOCALIZE A LOBAR SOURCE OF BLEEDING ARTERIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS CORRELATED WITH BRONCHOSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS BRONCHIAL ARTERIOGRAPHY MAY BE HELPFUL WHEN BRONCHOSCOPY CANNOT BE DONE BECAUSE OF CONTINUOUS HEMORRHAGE OR BECAUSE THE SEVERITY OF THE LUNG DISEASE PRECLUDES GENERAL ANESTHESIA BUT IT IS NOT AN ADEQUATE SUBSTITUTE FOR BRONCHOSCOPY IN MOST PATIENTS
341;THE AUTHORS STUDIED BRONCHIAL REACTIVITY IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND WITH DEFORMATIVE BRONCHITIS THE REACTION OF THE BRONCHI WAS STUDIED BOTH BY INHALATORY AND EXERCISE PROVOCATION INHALATORY TESTS WERE MONITORED BY MEANS OF A WHOLE BODY PLETHYSMOGRAPH FREE RANGE RUN WAS USED FOR THE EXERCISE TEST AND THE PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE WAS MEASURED THE DESCRIBED TECHNIQUE OF INHALATORY TESTS WAS ACCURATE SAFE AND NOT TIRING FOR THE PATIENT NO DISTINCT DIFFERENCE IN BRONCHIAL REACTION BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS COULD BE STATED THE BRONCHIAL REACTION TO THE INHALATORY AND EXERCISE TESTS WAS STRONGER IN BOTH GROUPS THAN IN NORMALS BUT NOT AS STRONG AS IN ASTHMATICS THE NATURE OF BRONCHIAL HYPERREACTIVITY IN THOSE PATIENTS IS STILL UNKNOWN THE INHALATORY TEST SEEMS TO BE MORE SENSITIVE THAN THE EXERCISE TEST IN DETECTING THAT HYPERREACTIVITY
342;AN INCIDENCE OF THE GENETIC RECESSIVE DISEASE CYSTIC FIBROSIS MUCOVISCIDOSIS FAR IN EXCESS OF THAT REPORTED RECENTLY FROM OTHER COUNTRIES HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERED IN THE SOUTH WEST AFRICAN AFRIKANER THIS HAS PROBABLY RESULTED FROM THE IMMIGRATION OF A SEGMENT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN AFRIKANER POPULATION RICH IN THE GENE INTO SOUTH WEST AFRICA WHERE FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS AND REASONS OF GEOGRAPHICAL ISOLATION THE GENE HAS PERSISTED AND PERHAPS INCREASED IN FREQUENCY MALARIA WHICH KILLED MANY OF THE EARLY SETTLERS MIGHT HAVE SELECTIVELY SPARED CARRIERS OF THE GENE THUS ENRICHING ITS OCCURRENCE IN THE POPULATION DETAILS OF PATIENTS PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE CRITERIA OF DIAGNOSIS ARE GIVEN WITH THE RELEVANT POPULATION AND BIRTH FIGURES FROM WHICH AN ESTIMATE OF THE INCIDENCE OF THE DISEASE AND OF ITS CARRIER RATE HAS BEEN MADE SCREENING OF THE NEWBORN FOR THE CONDITION AND THE COMPILING OF A REGISTER OF POTENTIAL AND OBLIGATORY CARRIERS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED
343;CYSTIC FIBROSIS SOMETIMES KNOWN AS MUCOVISCIDOSIS IS A GENERALISED DISORDER OF THE EXOCRINE GLANDS WHICH AFFECTS CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS NO BIOCHEMICAL ABNORMALITY MAY BE REGARDED AS THE PRIMARY CAUSE ALTHOUGH AT VARIOUS TIMES IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE DEFECT LIES IN ION TRANSPORT IN GLYCOPROTEIN STRUCTURE OR IN MEMBRANE PERMEABILITY CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS INHERITED AS A MENDELIAN RECESSIVE AND IS THE COMMONEST OF ALL SUCH GENETIC DISEASES IN THE CAUCASOID POPULATIONS OF WESTERN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA SUPER HAS DETECTED AND DOCUMENTED A FREQUENCY OF THE DISEASE AMONG CAUCASOIDS IN SOUTH WEST AFRICA WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THAT FOUND ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD AN INVESTIGATION OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THE DISEASE IN SOUTH WEST AFRICA MAY DIFFER CLINICALLY OR PATHOLOGICALLY FROM THAT FOUND ELSEWHERE IS NECESSARY
344;AN ELECTROPHORETIC TECHNIQUE FOR DEMONSTRATING AMYLASE ISOENZYMES IS DESCRIBED AFTER SEPARATION IN AN AGAROSE GEL CONTAINING A LINEAR POLYACRYLAMIDE POLYMER TO REDUCE ELECTROENDOSMOTIC FLOW THE AMYLASE FRACTIONS ARE VISUALIZED BY INCUBATION WITH A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DYE STARCH POLYMER PHADEBAS AMYLASE TEST THE TECHNIQUE DETECTS AMYLASE FRACTIONS WITH ACTIVITIES BELOW U L SOME CHARACTERISTIC CHANGES IN SUCH DISEASES AS ACUTE AND CHRONIC PANCREATITIS CYSTIC FIBROSIS OF THE PANCREAS MACROAMYLASEMIA AND INHERITED VARIANTS AS WELL AS AFTER MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY ARE MENTIONED
345;THE ISOAMYLASES IN VARIOUS HUMAN TISSUE HOMOGENATES AND BODY FLUIDS WERE SEPARATED BY AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS NOTHING SUGGESTED ANY SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION OF AMYLASE IN THE LIVER MINUTE AMOUNTS OF AMYLASE BELONGING TO THE PANCREATIC GROUP OF ISOAMYLASES MIGHT BE PRODUCED BY THE GLANDS OF THE PROXIMAL DUODENUM THE SPECIFIC GROUP OF ISOAMYLASES PRODUCED IN THE FEMALE GENITAL TRACT COULD NOT BE DEMONSTRATED IN SERUM OR URINE THE ACTIVITY OF AMYLASE IN SERUM WAS DERIVED FROM TWO GROUPS OF ISOENZYMES ONE GROUP ORIGINATING FROM THE SALIVARY GLANDS THE OTHER FROM THE PANCREATIC GLAND THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH OF THESE TWO SOURCES TO THE TOTAL SERUM AMYLASE WAS DETERMINED FROM EARLY FOETAL LIFE TO ADULT AGE A VERY LOW ACTIVITY OF THE SALIVARY ISOAMYLASES WAS REGULARLY FOUND IN SERUM FROM WEEK OLD FOETUSES THE ACTIVITY INCREASED STEADILY WITH AGE AND REACHED THE NORMAL ADULT LEVEL ABOUT U L AT THE AGE OF YEARS THE PANCREATIC GROUP OF ISOAMYLASES IN SERUM DEVELOPED LATER THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN BELOW MONTHS HAD NO DEMONSTRABLE PANCREATIC ISOAMYLASE ACTIVITY THE ACTIVITY ROSE SLOWLY TO REACH ADULT LEVEL ABOUT U L AT THE AGE OF TO YEARS THE ACTIVITY DID NOT VARY WITH SEX AND THE DIURNAL VARIATION OF THE ISOAMYLASE WAS NEGLIGIBLE IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS OF THE PANCREAS THE ACTIVITY OF PANCREATIC ISOAMYLASES IN SERUM WAS LOW
346;SERA FROM PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS WITH OTHER RESPIRATORY DISEASES AND CONTROL PERSONS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED FOR THE OCCURRENCE OF ANTIBACTERIAL PRECIPITINS AND AUTOANTIBODIES PRECIPTINS WERE STUDIED BY MEANS OF CROSSED IMMUNOELECTROPHORESIS ANTINUCLEAR FACTORS BY AN INDIRECT IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE TECHNIQUE AND RHEUMATOID FACTORS BY THE LATEX FIXATION SLIDE TEST A VERY HETEROGENEOUS ANTIBACTERIAL IMMUNE RESPONSE WAS FOUND IN PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS NOTABLY AS REGARDS PS AERUGINOSA NONE OF THE OTHER PATIENTS OR CONTROLS HAD PRECIPITINS AGAINST THIS BACTERIUM THE OCCURRENCE OF PRECIPITINS AGAINST ST AUREUS AND D PNEUMONIAE WERE MORE FREQUENT IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS AS COMPARED WITH CONTROLS BUT NOT AS COMPARED WITH OTHER RESPIRATORY DISEASE PATIENTS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND AS REGARDS PRECIPITINS AGAINST H INFLUENZAE OR THE OCCURRENCE OF RHEUMATOID FACTORS ANTINUCLEAR FACTORS WERE MORE FREQUENT IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS THAN IN THE OTHER TWO GROUPS INVESTIGATED A PRONOUNCED AND HETEROGENEOUS HUMORAL IMMUNE RESPONSE AGAINST PS AERUGINOSA IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS CHRONICALLY INFECTED WITH MUCOID STRAINS OF THIS BACTERIUM WAS FOUND TO BE CORRELATED WITH POOR PROGNOSIS AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS DISCUSSED
347;THE CONCENTRATIONS OF NINE PLASMA PROTEINS WERE DETERMINED BY QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOELECTROPHORESIS IN SPUTUM SPECIMENS FROM PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF AND FROM PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ASTHMA AND CHRONIC BRONCHITIS THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THE POPULATION OF CF PATIENTS COULD BE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS IN SPITE OF AN ABSENCE OF DIFFERENCE IN CLINICAL STATUS BETWEEN THE GROUPS AVERAGE CONCENTRATIONS OF SEVEN PLASMA PROTEINS IN SPUTUM OF GROUP I CF PATIENTS WERE IDENTICAL WITH THOSE IN SPUTUM OF PATIENTS WITH BRONCHITIS BUT THE AVERAGE CONCENTRATIONS OF SIX OF THESE PROTEINS IN SPUTUM FROM GROUP II CF PATIENTS WERE HIGHER THAN THOSE IN SPECIMENS FROM THE BRONCHITIC PATIENTS AND WERE SIMILAR TO CORRESPONDING CONCENTRATIONS IN SPUTUM FROM PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA ALL OF WHOM WERE EXAMINED WHILE IN STATUS ASTHMATICUS THE AVERAGE CONCENTRATIONS OF SECRETORY PROTEINS WERE THE SAME IN ALL SPUTUM SPECIMENS WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE PRODUCED BY PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ASTHMA OR BRONCHITIS IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE CONCENTRATIONS IN THE BRONCHOPULMONARY SECRETIONS OF PROTEINS ASSOCIATED WITH HOST DEFENCE WERE NOT DIMINISHED IN PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND FAILURE TO PRODUCE ADEQUATE CONCENTRATIONS OF PROTEINS WITH ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY WAS UNLIKELY TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ABOVE AVERAGE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO CHEST INFECTION IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THERE EXISTS A GROUP OF CF PATIENTS IN WHOM A PULMONARY ALLERGIC REACTION GENERATES AN INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AS SEVERE AS THAT CHARACTERIZING STATUS ASTHMATICUS AND THAT THIS RESPONSE COULD BE DETRIMENTAL
348;THE HEARTS AND LUNGS OF PATIENTS DYING OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAVE BEEN STUDIED TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RIGHT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY RVH PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE PULMONARY CIRCULATION AND THE CLINICAL FEATURES THE PRESENCE AND DEGREE OF RVH WERE MEASURED BY FULTON S TECHNIQUE OF WEIGHING THE VENTRICLES SEPARATELY OF THE SUBJECTS WHO DIED AFTER THE AGE OF YEARS ONE IN SIX HAD NO RVH ALTHOUGH THE MEAN AGE OF THIS GROUP WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE REMAINDER THERE WAS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN DURATION OF CYANOSIS HAEMOGLOBIN LEVELS AND RVH ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT THE CASES WITHOUT RVH TENDED TO HAVE HAD CLUBBING OF THE FINGER NAILS FOR LONGER PERIODS BEFORE DEATH THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM WAS USEFUL IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF RVH RIGHT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY WAS COMMON IN CHILDREN WITH LUNGS OF LARGE VOLUME AS JUDGED BY THE RADIOGRAPHIC CENTILE OF LUNG LENGTH CASES WITH RVH SHOW REDUCED BACKGROUND HAZE IN THE ARTERIOGRAM AND FEWER ARTERIES PER UNIT AREA OF LUNG FOR THE FIRST TIME THICKENING OF THE MEDIAL MUSCLE LAYER PROPORTIONAL TO THE DEGREE OF RVH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED ONLY IN THE SMALLER ARTERIES ARTERIAL SUBINTIMAL FIBROSIS IS MORE COMMON IN CASES WITH RVH AS IS THICKENING OF THE WALLS OF SMALL PULMONARY VEINS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED
349;THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF THE WRIGHT PEAK FLOWMETER FOR EVALUATION OF PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE WAS MEASURED WITH THE USE OF A WRIGHT PEAK FLOWMETER AND ONE SECOND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME MAXIMAL MID EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE AND MAXIMAL VOLUNTARY VENTILATION WERE MEASURED WITH A SPIROMETER IN A TOTAL OF CHILDREN OF WHOM HAD CYSTIC FIBROSIS DISEASE WITH THE REMAINDER BEING NORMAL MEASUREMENTS WERE REPEATED AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF BRONCHODILATING DRUGS TO THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS ALL THE VALUES OF THE FOUR MEASUREMENTS WERE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION CO EFFICIENTS WERE OBTAINED BY COMPARING THE PEAK FLOW RATE WITH OTHER SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE IS A FEASIBLE AND USEFUL MEASUREMENT OF PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS NO CHANGES WERE OBSERVED AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF BRONCHODILATING DRUGS TO THESE PATIENTS
350;THE CLINICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL FINDINGS OF CASES OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS OF THE PANCREAS FROM FULL BUT NON CONSECUTIVE NECROPSIES ARE PRESENTED ALL OF THESE CASES WERE DIAGNOSED AT POST MORTEM EXAMINATION THE AUTOPSY INCIDENCE WAS AND NONE OF THE CASES WAS BEYOND TWO YEARS OF AGE MORPHOLOGICAL FINDINGS REVEALED VARYING SEVERITIES IN ORGAN INVOLVEMENT IN ALL CASES WITH ABSENCE OF FIBROSIS OF THE PANCREAS IN SOME IN ONLY TWO CASES HISTOPATHOLOGICAL CHANGES SEEMED TO BE CONFINED TO THE PANCREAS THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT CYSTIC FIBROSIS PLAYS A CONSIDERABLE ROLE IN INFANT DEATHS IN OUR COUNTRY AND IN MOST IF NOT ALL CASES THE DIAGNOSIS MUST NECESSARILY BE BASED ON POSTMORTEM STUDIES
351;ALTHOUGH IT IS GENERALLY TRUE THAT MOST MALE PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ARE INFERTILE DUE TO CONGENITAL ATRESIA OR ABSENCE OF THE VASAL STRUCTURES THIS FINDING IS NOT INVARIABLE TAUSSIG ET AL REPORTED WELL STUDIED PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WHO HAD NORMAL SEMEN ANALYSIS AND AT THIS WRITING BOTH HAVE FATHERED CHILDREN A THIRD PATIENT WITH NORMAL SEMEN ANALYSIS ALSO IS KNOWN TO US IN ADDITION THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES OF PRESUMED BUT UNDOCUMENTED PATERNITY IN THESE PATIENTS CYSTIC FIBROSIS CENTERS ESTIMATE MALE FERTILITY AT TO PER CENT ALTHOUGH LOW THIS FIGURE WARRANTS SEMEN ANALYSIS BEFORE ASSUMING STERILITY IN VIEW OF THIS WE FEEL THAT THE DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE VASA ARE ABSENT BUT IT IS INCORRECT TO EXCLUDE THE DIAGNOSIS ON THE BASIS OF PALPABLE VASA

393;PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN AN ABNORMALITY OF THE SPERMIDINE TO SPERMINE SPD SPM RATIO IN WHOLE BLOOD OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS HOMO AND HETEROZYGOTES TO INVESTIGATE SPD AND SPM DISTRIBUTION AMOUNG BLOOD COMPONENTS AS A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE ABNORMALITY BLOOD WAS FRACTIONATED USING RABINOWITZ S GLASS BEAD TECHNIQUE AND BOYUM S FICOLL HYPAQUE METHOD FREE UNCONJUGATED POLYAMINES WERE EXTRACTED WITH PERCHLORIC ACID AND QUANTITATED ON AN AMINO ACID ANALYZER IN CONTROLS MEAN SEM CONCENTRATIONS IN NMOLES CELLS OF SPD AND SPM RESPECTIVELY WERE AND FOR ERYTHROCYTES AND FOR LYMPHOCYTES AND FOR GRANULOCYTES AND LESS THAN AND LESS THAN NMOLES ML FOR PLASMA WHEN CONVERTED TO THE CONCENTRATION IN WHOLE BLOOD IT WAS FOUND THAT GREATER THAN OF SPD AND OVER OF SPM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ERYTHROCYTES WHILE THE HIGHER CELLULAR CONCENTRATION IN LEUKOCYTES WAS NOT UNEXPECTED THE FACT THAT SPD AND SPM IN WHOLE BLOOD WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH ERYTHROCYTES WAS A NEW FINDING COMPARISON WITH CONTROLS REVEALED THAT THE SPD SPM RATIO IN BOTH WHOLE BLOOD AND ERYTHROCYTES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE GROUP OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS
394;LEUCOCYTES FROM PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF AND HEALTHY CONTROLS WERE INVESTIGATED BY MIGRATION INHIBITION INDUCED BY A VARIETY OF ANTIGENS IN PATIENTS WITH CF CELL MEDIATED IMMUNITY WAS FOUND TO HUMAN LUNG AND PANCREATIC TISSUE EXTRACTS AS WELL AS TO ASPERGILLUS FUMIGATUS PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA AND FOOD ANTIGENS BUT NOT TO BRAIN HEART OR KIDNEY THOSE PATIENTS WITH THE SEVEREST FORM OF THE DISEASE HAD THE GREATEST IMPAIRMENT OF CELL MEDIATED IMMUNITY BUT THIS IMPAIRMENT COULD BE REVERSED BY STEROID TREATMENT CELL MEDIATED CYTOTOXICITY MAY ALSO BE CONCERNED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF CF
395;WE WISH TO REPORT THREE CASES OF HYPONATRAEMIC DEHYDRATION IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ADMITTED TO THIS HOSPITAL IN LATE JUNE AND EARLY JULY THIS YEAR THESE THREE CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CLEARLY ILLUSTRATE THE DANGER OF THE PRESENT UNUSUAL CLIMATIC CONDITIONS THE NECESSITY OF SALT SUPPLEMENTATION IN THESE ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE EMPHASISED TO ALL CONCERNED AND ABOVE ALL TO PARENTS THE DANGER OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF SALT FREE GLUCOSE SOLUTIONS ALSO SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND IN THE PAST THE CASE HAS BEEN ARGUED FOR A SAFE ELECTROLYTE SOLUTION THAT WOULD BE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH A READILY AVAILABLE FORM OF ELECTROLYTE GLUCOSE SOLUTION PARENTS WILL NEED EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW THE SALT SUPPLEMENT SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED
396;ELEVEN EPISODES OF MECONIUM ILEUS EQUIVALENT HAVE BEEN SEEN IN SIX ADULTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS OF THE PANCREAS THREE PATIENTS WERE INITIALLY TREATED SURGICALLY ONE DIED AND THE OTHER TWO DEVELOPED SERIOUS POSTOPERATIVE CHEST INFECTIONS SIX EPISODES WERE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED MEDICALLY WITH ACETYLCYSTEINE ORALLY AND BY ENEMA NASOGASTRIC SUCTION AND INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS OPERATION SHOULD BE AVOIDED IF POSSIBLE AND MAINTENANCE TREATMENT WITH ACETYLCYSTEINE MAY BE NECESSARY TO PREVENT RELAPSE
397;WE AGREE WITH THE COMMENT OF DR FEIGHERY AND MR WOODS THAT A LOW MIGRATION INDEX SIGNIFIES SENSITIVITY TO AN ANTIGEN WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED ONLY BY FUNCTIONALLY ACTIVE IMMUNOCOMPETENT CELLS HOWEVER WE MUST EMPHASISE THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF ACTIVE IMMUNOCOMPETENT CELLS MAY OR MAY NOT BE IMPAIRED DEPENDING UPON THE ANTIGENS TO WHICH SUCH CELLS ARE SENSITISED SINCE COMPARATIVE CELLS FROM AGE MATCHED CONTROLS AND FROM BLOOD DONORS DID NOT SHOW SUCH SENSITISATION TO THOSE ANTIGENS TO WHICH THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS CELLS WERE SENSITISED THEN THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE NORMAL FUNCTION OF THESE IMMUNOCOMPETENT CELLS IN THE PATIENTS WITH CF IS INDEED IMPAIRED WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THAT STEROIDS ARE KNOWN IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS IT IS CERTAINLY NOT SURPRISING THAT TREATMENT OF THE CF PATIENTS WITH PREDNISOLONE CAUSED A DECREASED SENSITIVITY OF THESE SENSITISED CF CELLS TO THE ANTIGENS INDEED THERAPEUTIC CONCENTRATIONS OF STEROIDS WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE ABILITY OF SENSITISED SPLEEN CELLS AND OF LYMPH NODE CELLS TO DESTROY TARGET CELLS IN VITRO APART FROM THIS INHIBITION OF SENSITISED CELLS BY STEROIDS OF SENSITISED LYMPHOCYTES WERE KILLED WHEN PREDNISOLONE MG L WAS PRESENT DURING THE SENSITISATION PHASE IN ADDITION IT WAS OBSERVED IN MAN THAT IF CORTISOL OR PREDNISOLONE WAS GIVEN TWO HOURS BEFORE ABRADING THE SKIN THEN THERE OCCURRED A MARKED REDUCTION OF EMIGRATIONS OF BOTH MONONUCLEAR CELLS AND POLYMORPHS INTO THE AREA THUS INHIBITING THE MOBILISATION OF MACROPHAGES WE BELIEVE THAT THE SITUATION WITH REGARD TO STEROID THERAPY AND INHIBITION OF MIGRATION OF LEUKOCYTES FROM CF PATIENTS IS SIMILAR
398;CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF LIKE SYPHILIS COULD ACCURATELY BE DESCRIBED AS THE GREAT IMITATOR MANY ORGAN SYSTEMS ARE INVOLVED AND A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISEASE AND ITS MANY COMPLICATIONS IS A USEFUL EXERCISE IN UNDERSTANDING HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY CF COULD BE CALLED THICK SECRETION DISEASE BECAUSE ALL EXOCRINE FLUIDS LIKE PANCREATIC JUICE ARE THICK OR IT COULD BE CALLED MULTIMYSTERY DISEASE BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT IT MANY MANIFESTATIONS OF CF ARE UNDERSTANDABLE COMPLICATIONS OF MALABSORPTION MALNUTRITION AND THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ABNORMAL EXOCRINE SECRETION OTHERS INCLUDING THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO RECURRENT NASAL POLYPS THE HYPERSALINIZED SWEAT LOW FEMALE FERTILITY AND MALE STERILITY GIVEN PRESENT KNOWLEDGE DO NOT MAKE PHYSIOLOGIC SENSE
399;FIBROBLASTS DERIVED FROM INDIVIDUALS WITH MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS AN INBORN ERROR OF METABOLISM HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE MORE EASILY TRANSFORMED BY SIMIAN VIRUS THAN ARE CELLS DERIVED FROM NORMAL INDIVIDUALS THE INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY DOES NOT SEEM TO DEPEND UPON CHANGES IN GLYCOPROTEIN AT THE CELL SURFACE REPEATED OBSERVATIONS WERE NECESSARY TO DEMONSTRATE THESE DIFFERENCES AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS TEST IS SUITABLE FOR ROUTINE SCREENING FOR CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY

495;BECAUSE OF THE KNOWN INVOLVEMENT OF CYCLIC AMP IN THE CONTROL OF SECRETION IN EXOCRINE AND OTHER MAMMALIAN CELLS WE HAVE STUDIED CYCLIC AMP METABOLISM IN CULTURED CYSTIC FIBROSIS CELLS IN THE HOPES OF DEMONSTRATING SUCH AN ABNORMALITY A DETAILED COMPARISON OF CF AND CONTROL STRAINS SHOWED THAT THE CF CELLS SYNTHESIZED TIMES MORE INTRACELLULAR CYCLIC AMP THAN CONTROLS IN THIS PAPER WE PRESENT DATA ON AN ADDITIONAL CF AND CONTROL STRAINS MEASUREMENT OF INTRACELLULAR CYCLIC AMP DID NOT PROVIDE THE SAME CLEAR CUT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CF AND CONTROL STRAINS AS WE HAD PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED THE CF STRAINS SYNTHESIZED MORE CYCLIC AMP THAN CONTROLS BUT THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT AS LARGE AS IN OUR EARLIER STUDY AND THERE IS CONSIDERABLE OVERLAP BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY THESE TWO STUDIES SHOULD HAVE YIELDED SUCH DISPARATE RESULTS
496;A BIOCHEMICAL STUDY OF BRONCHIAL MUCINS IN SPUTUM FROM PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WAS UNDERTAKEN IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THEIR CHEMICAL FEATURES AND TO COMPARE THEM WITH BRONCHIAL MUCINS SECRETED IN OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL OR PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS THE MUCINS STUDIED IN THE PRESENT WORK WERE OBTAINED FROM THE INSOLUBLE AND FIBRILLAR PART OF SPUTUM IF BRONCHIAL MUCINS ARE THE MAIN GLYCOPROTEINS IN THE FIBRILLAR MUCUS THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A HIGH PROPORTION OF ACIDIC MUCINS WITHIN THE BRONCHIAL SECRETIONS FROM CF PATIENTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF ACIDIC MUCINS MAY NOT BE A SPECIFIC FEATURE OF CF SINCE THE SPUTUM FROM THE PATIENTS WITH OTHER DISEASES HAD A SIMILAR MUCIN DISTRIBUTION AS FAR AS CF IS CONCERNED IT IS PRESENTLY IMPOSSIBLE TO STATE WHETHER THE BRONCHIAL MUCINS REPRESENT NORMAL MUCINS OF THE CHILD OR STRUCTURALLY ABNORMAL MOLECULES
497;THIS PAPER REVIEWS SOME OF OUR EFFORTS TO COMPARE MUCOUS GLYCOPROTEINS FROM THE TRACHEOBRONCHIAL TRACT OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS WITH THOSE OF CONTROL SUBJECTS WE HAVE USED SECRETIONS FROM SEVERAL SOURCES INCLUDING SPUTUM BRONCHIAL WASHINGS OBTAINED WITH THE AID OF THE FIBEROPTIC BRONCHOSCOPE TRACHEOBRONCHIAL ASPIRATES THROUGH ENDOTRACHEAL OR TRACHEOSTOMY TUBES AND FINALLY SECRETIONS DISCHARGED BY HUMAN TRACHEOBRONCHIAL EPITHELIAL EXPLANTS SOLUBILIZATION AND FRACTIONATION OF SECRETIONS PROPERTIES OF THE MAJOR MUCOUS GLYCOPROTEIN COMPONENTS COMPOSITION OF MAJOR COMPONENTS FROM NON INFECTED BRONCHITIC AND CF LUNGS AND ORGAN CULTURE OF HUMAN TRACHEOBRONCHIAL EPITHELIUM ARE DISCUSSED

703;CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS THE MOST COMMON FORM OF CHRONIC PULMONARY DISEASE IN THE PEDIATRIC AGE GROUP AS THESE CHILDREN SURVIVE LONGER WITH IMPROVED THERAPY THE INCIDENCE OF PNEUMOTHORAX HAS INCREASED IN OUR PATIENTS WHO WERE MORE THAN YEARS OF AGE THE INCIDENCE OF PNEUMOTHORAX WAS PERCENT WE HAVE REVIEWED THE RECORDS OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD EPISODES OF PNEUMOTHORAX COMPLICATING CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN ADDITION OUR EXPERIENCE INCLUDES ONE CHILD WITH HISTIOCYTOSIS IN WHOM PNEUMOTHORAX WAS A SERIOUS COMPLICATION ONE OTHER PNEUMOTHORAX OCCURRED IN A TEEN AGE GIRL WITH APICAL BULLOUS DISEASE A CHILD WHO PRESENTS WITH EVEN A MINIMAL PNEUMOTHORAX COMPLICATING CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS AT CONSIDERABLE RISK OF DEVELOPING AN INCREASING LUNG COLLAPSE EVEN IF THE PNEUMOTHORAX RESOLVES THERE IS A HIGH RISK OF RECURRENCE IN CHILDREN TREATED WITH ONLY A CHEST TUBE THERE WAS A PERCENT RECURRENCE CONSEQUENTLY WE RECOMMEND A CHEST TUBE FOR ANY EPISODE OF PNEUMOTHORAX IN A CHILD WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WITH INSTALLATION OF A SCLEROSING AGENT WHEN THE LUNG EXPANDS THREE OF OUR PATIENTS SO TREATED HAD NO RECURRENCE CHILDREN WHO HAVE A PERSISTENT AIR LEAK ARE CONFINED TO BED RETAIN SECRETIONS AND PURSUE A RAPID DOWNHILL COURSE A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO THESE CHILDREN CONSISTING OF THORACOTOMY SUTURE OF THE AIR LEAK PTEURAL SYMPHYSIS AND PULMONARY LAVAGE IS FEASIBLE AND THE MORTALITY RATE IS LOW A PNEUMOTHORAX IN A CHILD WITH NO EVIDENCE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS A RARE EVENT A PERSISTENT AIR LEAK IS AN INDICATION FOR THORACOTOMY SUTURE OF THE AIR LEAK AND LUNG BIOPSY HISTIOCYTOSIS X IS ONE RARE CAUSE FOR THIS COMPLICATION IN CHILDREN
704;CYSTIC FIBROSIS C F WAS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED AS A SINGLE DISEASE BY ANDERSON IN ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY CASE REPORTS HAD APPEARED IN THE EUROPEAN LITERATURE SUBSEQUENTLY C F HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN ARAB IRAQI CHILDREN SEVENTEEN CASES OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS WERE DIAGNOSED AT MEDICAL CITY TEACHING COLLEGE HOSPITAL UNIVERSITY OF BAGHDAD BETWEEN AND IN THIS STUDY THE SEX RATIO WAS THIS COMPARED WITH THE ROUGHLY EQUAL RATIO USUALLY QUOTED A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THIS DISCREPANCY IS THE PREFERENCE GIVEN TO BOYS IN IRAQI FAMILIES AND MEDICAL ATTENTION IS MORE LIKELY TO BE SOUGHT ON THEIR BEHALF
705;THE NUMBER OF ADULTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF RECEIVING CARE FROM THE US CYSTIC FIBROSIS CENTERS HAS BEEN INCREASING AT AN AVERAGE RATE OF ABOUT PATIENTS EACH YEAR A MODEL BASED ON THE CONTINUATION OF THIS RATE OF INCREASE PREDICTS THAT ALMOST ADULTS WILL BE RECEIVING CARE AT THE CENTERS BY THE END OF FOUR OTHER MODELS DEVELOPED ARE BASED ON CONTINUATION OF A STEADY STATE WITH TWO VARIATIONS A REDUCTION IN MORTALITY AND UNIVERSAL NEWBORN SCREENING THESE MODELS SHOW THE BOUNDARIES OF AN EQUILIBRIUM POPULATION TO BE BETWEEN AND PATIENTS WITH TO ADULTS
706;SEROTYPING OF MUCOID STRAINS ISOLATED FROM CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS WAS CARRIED OUT BY SLIDE AGGLUTINATION TESTS WITH BOTH LIVE AND HEAT KILLED CELLS AND BY TUBE AGGLUTINATION TEST WITH HEAT KILLED CELLS COMPARISON OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY THESE METHODS REVEALED THAT TUBE AGGLUTINATION WITH HEAT KILLED CELLS WAS THE SUPERIOR METHOD MORE THAN HALF THE STRAINS WERE FOUND TO BE HOMMA S SEROTYPE GROUP M IN THE NEW SCHEMA SLIDE AGGLUTINATION WITH LIVE CELLS DID NOT GIVE CLEAR RESULTS SOME STRAINS SHOWED OCCASIONALLY POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE AGGLUTINATIONS AGAINST THE SAME SEROTYPE SERUM CHANGES IN SEROTYPES GROUPS IN THE NEW SCHEMA WERE FOUND IN SOME STRAINS ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER WAS VERY SMALL
707;USING BIOASSAY METHOD RAT BLOOD PRESSURE TECHNIQUE AS WELL AS THE RADIOIMMUNOASSAY RENIN LIKE ACTIVITY RLA WAS MEASURED IN ECCRINE SWEAT OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS OF THE PANCREAS CF AND OF CONTROLS SWEAT FORMATION WAS INDUCED BY PILOCARPINE IONTOPHORESIS OR BY LOCAL INJECTION OF CARBAMYLCHOLINE DORYL RLA VALUES BETWEEN O NOT MEASURABLE AND NG ML H WERE MEASURED WITH INCREASING SWEAT FLOW RATE A TENDENCY TO LOWER RLA VALUES WAS DETECTED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN CF AND CONTROLS FROM THE OBSERVATION THAT RLA OF SWEAT IS UP TO TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OF PLASMA IT IS CONCLUDED THAT RLA IS PROBABLY RELEASED NOT FROM PLASMA BUT FROM THE SWEAT GLANDS THEMSELVES WHERE IT IS STORED OR SYNTHESIZED
708;THE ABSORPTION OF BIOSYNTHETICALLY FE LABELED HEMIGLOBIN PORK AND HOG LIVER CO VITAMIN B AND SE SELENOMETHIONIN LABELED PORK WAS MEASURED IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS BY WHOLE BODY COUNTING OF THE ABSORBED RADIONUCLIDES WITHIN THE PI GEOMETRY OF A LARGE VOLUME RADIOACTIVITY DETECTOR WITH LIQUID ORGANIC SCINTILLATOR
709;THE ABSORPTION OF FE FROM A DIAGNOSTIC MG FE DOSE WAS MEASURED BY PI GEOMETRY WHOLE BODY COUNTING AND RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF STAINABLE DIFFUSE CYTOPLASMATIC NON HEME STORAGE IRON IN THE BONE MARROW MACROPHAGES OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WHEN THE STORAGE IRON WAS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ABSORBED XA S D OF THE ORAL FE DOSE WHICH IS IDENTICAL WITH THE FE ABSORPTION IN NORMAL CHILDREN WITH NORMAL IRON STORES DEPLETED IRON STORES CAUSED AN INCREASE OF FE ABSORPTION TO XA S D IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND TO XA S D IN CONTROL CHILDREN THE INTERRUPTION OR CONTINUATION OF PANCREATIN MAINTENANCE THERAPY AND THE SIMULTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF G PANCREATIN DID NOT INFLUENCE FE ABSORPTION IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR A PANCREATIC FACTOR REQUIRED FOR OR INHIBITING INORGANIC AND FOOD IRON ABSORPTION IN HUMAN BEINGS IRON ABSORPTION IS CONTROLLED ALSO IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS CHIEFLY BY THE AMOUNTS OF AVAILABLE STORAGE IRON IT IS THEREFORE NOT JUSTIFIED TO APPREHEND THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEMOSIDEROSIS IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WHO ARE NOT OR NOT SUFFICIENTLY TREATED WITH PANCREATIN
710;THE SYNTHESIS TRANSPORT AND SECRETION OF GLYCOPROTEIN BY HUMAN RECTAL EPITHELIUM FROM NORMAL VOLUNTEERS PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND THEIR DISEASE FREE SIBLINGS WERE STUDIED BY AUTORADIOGRAPHY OF RECTAL BIOPSIES PULSE LABELED WITH H GLUCOSAMINE AND MAINTAINED IN ORGAN CULTURE FOR VARIOUS INTERVALS OF UP TO HOURS HUMAN RECTAL GOBLET AND COLUMNAR CELLS TRANSPORTED H GLUCOSAMINE LABELED SECRETORY PRODUCTS AT A SUBSTANTIALLY SLOWER RATE THAN DO COMPARABLE COLONIC CELLS IN SMALLER MAMMALS WITHIN ANY ONE BIOPSY SAMPLE THE MOVEMENT OF LABELED MUCUS IN GOBLET CELLS VARIED WIDELY AMONG CELLS EVEN WITH INDIVIDUAL CELLS LABELED MUCOUS GRANULES OFTEN DID NOT MOVE IN CONCERT TOWARD THE APICAL CELL SURFACE AVERAGE TRANSPORT TIME IN THE CELLS OF SIX CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS AND SIX SIBLING CONTROLS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE OF FOUR ADULT CONTROLS THE CARBOHYDRATE COMPOSITION OF GLYCOPROTEIN SECRETIONS OF RECTAL EPITHELIAL CELLS WAS INVESTIGATED BY COMPARING AUTORADIOGRAPHS OF H GLUCOSAMINE LABELED BIOPSIES WITH THOSE LABELED WITH H FUCOSE H N ACETYLMANNOSAMINE AND S SULFATE THE PATTERNS OF INCORPORATION OF THESE FOUR PRECRUSORS INTO NORMAL GOBLET AND COLUMNAR CELLS SUGGESTED THAT BOTH CELL TYPES MAY ALTER THE QUANTITY AND COMPOSITION OF NEWLY SYNTHESIZED GLYCOPROTEINS AS THEY MIGRATE MATURE AND SENESCE INCORPORATION PATTERNS IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS BIOPSIES WERE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THOSE OF SIBLING OR ADULT CONTROLS WITH THE TECHNIQUES USED NO ABNORMALITIES OF EPITHELIAL GLYCOPROTEIN PRODUCTION WERE DETECTED IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS RECTAL MUCOSA
711;WE HAVE STUDIED SEVEN PATIENTS WITH C F AND TEN NORMAL CHILDREN AND HAVE CONFIRMED THE LOW LEVELS OF E F A BOTH IN PLASMA AND IN RED CELL MEMBRANE IN THE C F GROUP WE WOULD LIKE TO REPORT HERE PRELIMINARY RESULTS ON THE FATTY ACID PATTERN OF THE LECITHIN FRACTION OF BRONCHIAL MUCUS IN THE SAME GROUP OF PATIENTS AND CONTROLS CONTENT OF PALMITIC ACID WAS LOWER AND THAT OF OLEIC ACID WAS HIGHER IN THE C F PATIENTS THAN IN NORMAL CHILDREN THIS ABNORMALITY IN THE FATTY ACID COMPOSITION OF THE LECITHIN OF THE MUCUS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT FINDING IN RELATION TO THE RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS IN C F SOME EXPERIMENTAL WORK SUPPORTS THIS HYPOTHESIS
713;THE BM MECONIUM TEST IS A USEFUL SCREENING TEST FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS HOWEVER WE HAVE HAD FALSE POSITIVE RESULTS IN TWO BABIES CAUSED BY THE USE OF RECTAL GLYCERIN SUPPOSITORIES THE BABIES PRESENTED WITH SIGNS SUGGESTIVE OF INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION POSSIBLY DUE TO MECONIUM ILEUS AND GLYCERIN SUPPOSITORIES WERE INSERTED TO SPEED THE PASSAGE OF MECONIUM SO THAT THE BM TEST COULD BE DONE TO HELP CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS THE TESTS WERE POSITIVE BUT THE BABIES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY SHOWN NOT TO HAVE CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND WE FOUND THAT THE GLYCERIN SUPPOSITORIES THEMSELVES PRODUCE THE TYPICAL BLUE COLOUR ON THE TEST STRIP
714;INCREASED SODIUM CONCENTRATION IN SWEAT IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS HOWEVER WE HAVE READ NOTHING ON THE SODIUM CONTENT OF BREAST MILK IN THIS CONDITION A PATIENT WITH SWEAT TEST PROVED CYSTIC FIBROSIS WITH MILD PULMONARY DISEASE HAD HER FIRST BABY BY NORMAL DELIVERY AT TERM SAMPLES OF BREAST MILK WERE OBTAINED ON THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH DAYS POST PARTUM WHEN THE MOTHER WAS NOT BREAST FEEDING THE TWO SODIUM CONCENTRATIONS WERE AND MMOL L CONCENTRATIONS MUCH HIGHER THAN IN ANY OTHER MILK SAMPLE TESTED AT THIS HOSPITAL IN A LARGE SURVEY AND HIGHER THAN ANY WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LITERATURE MILK OF SUCH HIGH SODIUM CONTENT WOULD BE UNSAFE FOR A BABY AND WE SUGGEST THAT IF MOTHERS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WERE TO BREAST FEED THE SODIUM OF THE MILD SHOULD BE MEASURED FIRST THE BREAST LIKE SO MANY OTHER EXOCRINE GLANDS SEEMS TO BE AFFECTED BY THE SECRETORY ABNORMALITIES OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS
715;THE PERCENTAGE FATTY ACID COMPOSITION OF THE VARIOUS PLASMA LIPID FRACTIONS FROM CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS WITH AND WITHOUT PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY OBLIGATE HETEROZYGOTES AND NORMAL SUBJECTS WAS DETERMINED ONLY THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS WITH PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY ABNORMAL FATTY ACID COMPOSITION THIS GENERAL OBSERVATION DID NOT CORRELATE WITH VITAMIN E DEFICIENCY AGE SEX OR SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE THUS THE ALTERED FATTY ACID COMPOSITION OF THE DIFFERENT PLASMA LIPID FRACTIONS APPEARS TO BE A SECONDARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND NOT A DIRECT METABOLIC DEFECT RELATED TO THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS GENE ITSELF
716;WE FOUND THAT THE SZCZEPANSKI BROMIDE TEST WHICH WE SIMPLIFIED WITH THE AID OF ION SENSITIVE ELECTRODE IS SUITABLE FOR THE DETECTION OF C F HETEROZYGOSITY IN MOST CASES WE EXAMINED THE SWEAT OF RANDOMLY SELECTED CHILDREN WITH RESPIRATORY ASTHMA DURING THE PAST YEARS THE SODIUM AND CHLORIDE CONCENTRATIONS AND BROMIDE INDEX BEING DETERMINED SODIUM AND CHLORIDE CONCENTRATIONS IN THE SWEAT OF THE ASTHMA CHILDREN WERE SLIGHTLY BUT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER P THAN THOSE OF THE CONTROLS THE DIFFERENCE IN BROMIDE INDEX WAS EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT P THIS SUGGESTS THAT C F GENE CARRIERS ARE UNUSUALLY PREVALENT AMONG CHILDREN WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT ENHANCED ION LOSS IN VARIOUS DISEASES WITH ALLERGIC PATHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS IS SECONDARY IN NATURE HOWEVER THIS SEEMS UNLIKELY SINCE IN OUR MATERIAL HIGH SWEAT ELECTROLYTE CONCENTRATIONS WERE OBSERVED IN ONLY A PROPORTION OF CONTROL CHILDREN WHOSE ILLNESS WAS SIMILAR IN SEVERITY TO THAT OF THE ASTHMATIC CHILDREN AND NORMAL SWEAT VALUES WERE OBTAINED EVEN WHEN THE CHILD S CONDITION WAS VERY SERIOUS
717;IN A NEW METHOD OF TESTING STOOL SAMPLES FROM NEWBORN BABIES FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS C F A COLOURLESS SUBSTRATE BENZOYL ARGININE P NITROANILIDE B A P N A RELEASES YELLOW P NITROANILINE WHEN HYDROLYSED BY TRYPSIN SAMPLES FROM INFANTS WITH C F WHO LACK TRYPSIN GIVE NEGLIGIBLE COLOUR INFANTS WITH C F WERE DETECTED AMONG CONSECUTIVE NEWBORN BABIES TESTED THE INCIDENCE OF FALSE POSITIVE RESULTS WAS AFTER THE FIRST SPECIMEN AND AFTER THE SECOND SPECIMEN A FURTHER REFINEMENT HAS REDUCED THE POSITIVE RATE TO AFTER THE FIRST SPECIMEN SAMPLES TESTS ON SAMPLES FROM OTHER OLDER PATIENTS WITH UNTREATED C F HAVE YIELDED NO EVIDENCE FOR FALSE NEGATIVE RESULTS
718;IN THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE ISOLATED THY STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS FROM THE SPUTUM OF FOUR CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WHO WERE RECEIVING CO TRIMOXAZOLE AND LATELY WE HAVE ISOLATED A THY STRAIN OF HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE FROM A PATIENT WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ALSO RECEIVING CO TRIMOXAZOLE IN VIEW OF THE EXACTING GROWTH REQUIREMENTS OF H INFLUENZAE WE FEEL THAT THY STRAINS MIGHT EASILY BE OVERLOOKED OR ASSUMED TO HAVE DIED WHEN THEY FAIL TO GROW ON SENSITIVITY TEST MEDIA
719;LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF MALABSORPTION SYNDROMES IN CHILDREN IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS INVOLVING THE COLLECTION OF SPECIMENS THE EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS EXTREMELY URGENT SINCE THE DISEASE IS TREATABLE THE STANDARD TEST IS THE SWEAT TEST OVER PERCENT OF PATIENTS WITH THIS DISEASE WILL HAVE ELEVATION OF SODIUM AND CHLORIDE IN THE SWEAT THREE TESTS ARE USED TO ASSESS PANCREATIC FUNCTION FIRST IS THE MEASUREMENT OF STOOL TRYPSIN AND CHYMOTRYPSIN SECOND STIMULATION WITH HORMONES THE STANDARD SECRETIN AND CCK TESTS A THIRD PROCEDURE TESTS CARBOHYDRATE TOLERANCE AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TEST SINCE AN EVER GROWING NUMBER OF PATIENTS IN LATE CHILDHOOD AND EARLY ADULTHOOD WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ARE BEING FOUND TO HAVE DIABETES MELLITUS THE COMMONEST AND MOST IMPORTANT HEREDITARY DISEASE THAT AFFECTS PANCREATIC FUNCTION IS CYSTIC FIBROSIS THE COMMONEST FORM OF PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY IN CHILDHOOD IS MUCOVISCIDOSIS OR CYSTIC FIBROSIS OF THE PANCREAS THE INCIDENCE OF THIS DISEASE IS APPROXIMATELY ONE PER LIVE BIRTHS IT OCCURS IN ALL RACES AND THE DEFECT IS TRANSMITTED AS AN AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE THE CLASSIC FEATURES ARE FREQUENT BOWEL MOVEMENTS WITH THE CHARACTERISTIC APPEARANCE OF STEATORRHEIC STOOLS AND A FAILURE TO GROW AND DEVELOP NORMALLY
720;A CASE INCLUDING AUTOPSY FINDINGS IS REPORTED OF MULTILOBULAR BILIARY CIRRHOSIS WITH A STRICTLY NODULAR LIVER DEVELOPING IN A YEAR OLD MALE WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS MUCOVISCIDOSIS THE PATHOGENESIS OF BILIARY CIRRHOSIS IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED
721;CURRENTLY EMPLOYED METHODS FOR THE ASSAY OF ELECTROLYTES IN SWEAT RELEVANT TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS ARE CRITICALLY EVALUATED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE MEASUREMENT OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO THE FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR POTENTIALLY LARGE ERRORS ON THE BASIS OF EXPERIMENTATION SUPPORTED BY LABORATORY PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE REDUCTION OF THESE ERRORS TO CLINICALLY ACCEPTABLE LEVELS DATA CONCERNING SODIUM AND POTASSIUM CONTENT ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AND OSMOLALITY OF UNDILUTED SWEAT COLLECTIONS ARE COMPARED THE FEASIBILITY AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES OF MEASURING SWEAT OSMOLALITY WITH A VAPOUR PRESSURE OSMOMETER ARE DISCUSSED
722;WE HAVE PRESENTED A GROUP OF PATIENTS OVER YEARS OF AGE AS OF JANUARY WHO WERE DIAGNOSED AS HAVING CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF AT VARIOUS AGES FROM BIRTH TO YEARS SOME PATIENTS WERE DIAGNOSED LATE IN LIFE IN SPITE OF CLASSICAL SYMPTOMS AND A CHARACTERISTIC HISTORY OF THE DISEASE PATIENTS WITH CF PRESENT WITH A BROAD SPECTRUM OF SYMPTOMS WHICH VARY CONSIDERABLY IN SEVERITY THIS OLDER AGE GROUP REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY OF OUR CURRENT ROSTER OF PATIENTS WITH CF THIS DISEASE IS NO LONGER CONFINED TO EARLY LIFE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SEEN WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IN OLDER PATIENTS OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THIS DISEASE INDICATES THAT A NUMBER OF AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS CAN ATTAIN ADULTHOOD AND FIND A USEFUL PLACE IN SOCIETY THE QUALITY OF LIFE PROVIDED TO THESE ADULTS IS ILLUSTRATED IN THEIR INTELLECTUAL SOCIOECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS AND MARITAL LIFE OUR AIM HAS BEEN TO RECOGNIZE THE DISEASE AS EARLY IN LIFE AS POSSIBLE AND TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH CARE
723;THE INTESTINAL BRUSH BORDER IS A COMPLEX ORGANELLE THAT CONTAINS HYDROLYTIC ENZYMES RECEPTORS OTHER PROTEINS INVOLVED IN TRANSPORT AND CONTRACTILE PROTEINS IN THIS ARTICLE WE REVIEW THE MOLECULAR ORGANIZATION OF BRUSH BORDER PROTEINS WITHIN THE WHOLE MEMBRANE AND DISCUSS THEIR SYNTHESIS AND TURNOVER THIS KNOWLEDGE PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH CERTAIN DISEASES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN BRUSH BORDER PROTEINS

773;DR SOLDIN DESCRIBES A METHOD OF COLLECTING SWEAT FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS WHICH INVOLVES PLACING THE PATIENT ON AN ELECTRIC BLANKET AND WRAPPING HIM WARMLY FOR HOURS UNTIL PROFUSE SWEATING HAS OCCURRED FOR MINUTES ONE IMPORTANT OMISSION FROM THE TITLE AND THE ABSTRACT IS ANY MENTION OF SAFETY CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS MAY DEVELOP HEAT PROSTRATION WHEN EXPOSED TO HIGH TEMPERATURES WHICH MAY CAUSE MASSIVE SODIUM AND CHLORIDE LOSSES VIA THE SWEAT THIS COULD OCCUR WITH THE METHOD DESCRIBED THE APPARATUS DESCRIBED BY GIBSON AND COOKE IN THE CLASSIC PILOCARPINE IONTOPHORESIS METHOD OF COLLECTING SWEAT IS NEITHER OVERLY SOPHISTICATED NOR EXPENSIVE IT REMAINS THE METHOD OF CHOICE ALTHOUGH ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS IMPORTANT
774;IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO SCREEN FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE CARRIER STATE OF A NUMBER OF INHERITED DISEASES SUCH SCREENING CAN ALERT ONE TO THE NEED FOR ANTENATAL DIAGNOSIS WHERE FEASIBLE IT CAN ENSURE THAT EARLY TREATMENT IS GIVEN TO AFFECTED INFANTS AND IT CAN ASSIST CARRIERS IN REACHING A DECISION ABOUT HAVING CHILDREN FACILITIES FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF SCREENING ALREADY EXIST IN SOME CENTRES IN SOUTH AFRICA AND NEW TECHNIQUES WILL BE INTRODUCED IN THE FUTURE
775;SIX PATIENTS WITH MECONIUM ILEUS IN WHOM BOWEL RESECTION AND END TO END ANASTOMOSIS WERE PERFORMED ARE PRESENTED MECONIUM ILEUS MAY BE SIMPLE OR COMPLICATED THE SIMPLE FORM MAY BE TREATED BY GASTROGRAFIN ENEMA SURGERY IS INDICATED IF CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT FAILS AND FOR PATIENTS WITH A COMPLICATED OBSTRUCTION PROVIDED THE BOWEL IS DISOBSTRUCTED AND CAREFULLY RESECTED END TO END ANASTOMOSIS IS PREFERABLE CONFIRMATION OF THE DIAGNOSIS BY CAREFUL HISTOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE RESECTED BOWEL IS URGED
776;CYSTIC FIBROSIS C F IS A SERIOUS GENETIC DISORDER OCCURRING MAINLY AMONG THE WHITES AND STARTING IN EARLY CHILDHOOD OR EVEN AT BIRTH THE NAME IS A SHORTENING OF THE OLD TERM CYSTIC FIBROSIS OR FIBROCYSTIC DISEASE OF THE PANCREAS THIS COMES FROM THE HISTORICAL APPEARANCE AT POST MORTEM FIRST DESCRIBED BY LANDSTEINER IN IT WAS ONLY IN THAT DOROTHEE ANDERSON AND FANCONI REALISED THAT THE DISEASE WAS A SEPARATE ENTITY AND NOT SIMPLY A MANIFESTATION OF OTHER ILLNESSES ANOTHER NAME IS MUCOVISCIDOSIS WHICH GIVES A CLUE AS TO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THE DISEASE MUCUS FORMED IS THICKER AND STICKIER MORE VISCID THAN NORMAL AND TENDS TO CLOG UP THE BRONCHI AND DUCTS PARTICULARLY THE PANCREATIC DUCTS CHRONIC BRONCHITIS WITH RECURRENT SEVERE INFECTION AND MALABSORPTION ARE THE MAIN SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE THE OTHER IMPORTANT ABNORMALITY IS AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF SODIUM CHLORIDE SALT IN THE SWEAT THIS FACT USED IN THE DIAGNOSIS WAS FIRST REALISED DURING A HEAT WAVE IN NEW YORK IN WHEN IT WAS NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE CHILDREN WITH HEAT PROSTRATION SUFFERED FROM C F LITTLE IS KNOWN OF THE CAUSES OF THE ABNORMALITIES OF SWEAT AND MUCUS SOME GENERALISED CELL ABNORMALITY ENZYMATIC SEEMS POSSIBLE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE CONDITION IS GENETICALLY TRANSMITTED AND MOST EVIDENCE FAVOURS A RECESSIVE MODE OF INHERITANCE
777;THE PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION WAS TO ELUCIDATE THE VARIATION OF THE ISOENZYMES OF HUMAN AMYLASE IN HEALTH AND DISEASE AS WELL AS PHYSICO CHEMICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL ISOAMYLASES IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS DETERMINATION OF SERUM ISOAMYLASE IS OF VALUE ALTHOUGH ABSENCE OF PANCREATIC SERUM ISOAMYLASE IS A NORMAL FINDING DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE DEMONSTRABLE PANCREATIC SERUM ISOAMYLASE IN SUCH EARLY LIFE ARGUES AGAINST THE DIAGNOSIS AFTER ONE YEAR OF AGE THE TEST HAS A POSITIVE DIAGNOSTIC VALUE
778;A TOTAL OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED FOR UP TO YEARS WITH MONTHLY EXAMINATIONS INCLUDING BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS OF SPUTUM SERA FROM THE PATIENTS WERE EXAMINED BY MEANS OF CROSSED IMMUNOELECTROPHORESIS FOR THE OCCURENCE AND NUMBER OF PRECIPITATING ANTIBODY SPECIFICITES AGAINST PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA POOR PROGNOSIS IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC COLONIZATION MONTHS MORE THAN YEARS OF THE RESPIRATORY TRACT WITH MUCOID PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA AND WITH AN ONSET OF THE CHRONIC COLONIZATION BEFORE PUBERTY AMONG THE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA COLONIZATION POOR PROGNOSIS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH NUMBERS OF PRECIPITINS AGAINST ANTIGENS FROM THESE BACTERIA UP TO THE NUMBER OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA PRECIPITINS INCREASED ON AN AVERAGE WITH FIVE PER YEAR IN CHRONICALLY COLONIZED PATIENTS RAPIDLY INCREASING NUMBER OF PRECIPITINS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR PROGNOSIS PATIENTS WITH ANY DEGREE OF IMPAIRMENT OF THE VENTILATORY FUNCTION AND ANY CHANGES ON THE CHEST RADIOGRAPHS COULD CONTRACT CHRONIC PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA COLONIZATION POOR VENTILATORY FUNCTION AND SEVERE CHANGES ON THE CHEST RADIOGRAPHS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH NUMBERS OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA PRECIPITINS AND WITH POOR PROGNOSIS ALTHOUGH MANY O GROUPS OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA WERE FOUND IN THE CHRONICALLY COLONIZED GROUP OF PATIENTS OF THE PATIENTS HARBOURED STRAINS BELONGING TO O GROUP OR AND THE HIGHEST NUMBERS OF PRECIPITINS WERE FOUND IN SERUM FROM THESE PATIENTS

780;THIRTY THREE PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WERE HLA TYPED RELATIVE RISK VALUES AND PHENOTYPE FREQUENCIES WERE CALCULATED NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE HLA ANTIGEN DISTRIBUTION WERE FOUND AMONG THE PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS
781;WE RECENTLY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY A FOUR MONTH OLD BOY WITH FAILURE TO THRIVE HYPOCHLOREMIC METABOLIC ALKALOSIS HIGH SERUM ALDOSTERONE VALUES AND WHO WAS FOUND TO HAVE CYSTIC FIBROSIS CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAVE MODERATELY ELEVATED PLASMA RENIN AND SECONDARILY ELEVATED SERUM ALDOSTERONE VALUE THIS IS DUE TO CHRONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE LOSS THROUGH SWEAT OUR PATIENT HAD HIGH SERUM ALDOSTERONE VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH ONLY SLIGHTLY ELEVATED SERUM CORTISOL VALUE HIGH SERUM ALDOSTERONE VALUE INCREASED FURTHER DESPITE CORRECTING CONDITIONS WHICH STIMULATE ALDOSTERONE SECRETION THIS SUGGESTS THAT LONG STANDING SALT DEPLETION IS NOT THE ONLY CAUSE FOR ABNORMAL RENIN ALDOSTERONE SYSTEM
782;THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE FREQUENCY AND ETIOLOICAL FACTORS OF NEUROAXONAL DYSTROPHY N D IN BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD OF CHILDREN WITH VARIOUS NON NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES THE MATERIALS USED IN THIS STUDY CONSISTED OF CONSECUTIVE AUTOPSIES FROM AND AN ADDITIONAL CASES FROM PREVIOUS YEARS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF N D IN CHILDREN WAS CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS PARTICULARLY VINCRISTINE USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF MALIGNANT TUMORS APPROXIMATELY OF THESE CHILDREN DEVELOPED N D AND THE CHANGES RANGED FROM MILD TO SEVERE APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE DEVELOPED N D AND THE CHANGES WERE MOSTLY MILD ONLY ONE THIRD OF PATIENTS WITH CONGENITAL BILIARY ATRESIA AND MALNUTRITION DEVELOPED N D AND THE CHANGES WERE ALWAYS MILD THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF N D INCREASED IN PATIENTS WHO HAD PROLONGED CLINICAL COURSES NO N D WAS SEEN IN PATIENTS WHO DIED FROM ACUTE CASES SUCH AS TRAUMA ACUTE INFECTION INTOXICATION ACUTE RENAL FAILURE OR PREMATURITY THIS TYPE OF N D MAY BE CONSIDERED AS REACTIVE TO A WIDE VARIETY OF INJURIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS DRUG TOXICITY MALNUTRITION CHRONIC HYPOXIA AND CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE EITHER ALONE OR IN COMBINATION IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS REPORTS OF A LOW INCIDENCE OF N D IN CHILDREN THERE HAS BEEN A SHARP INCREASE IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE ADVENT OF CHEMOTHERAPY
783;ON THE BASIS OF OBSERVATIONS IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS SEEN FROM JANUARY TO JUNE IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE RELATIVE UNDERWEIGHT WEIGHT LOSS CORRECTED FOR HEIGHT IS MOST PRONOUNCED IN CHILDREN WITH PREDOMINANTLY PULMONARY SYPMTOMS THE DEGREE OF UNDERWEIGHT CLOSELY CORRELATES INVERSELY WITH SURVIVAL BECAUSE OF ITS PROGNOSTIC VALUE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS CLINICAL PARAMETER BE INCLUDED IN THE CHECKUPS WHICH ARE PERIODICALLY CARRIED OUT ON CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM CYSTIC FIBROSIS
784;FOUR PATIENTS ARE PRESENTED AGED TO YEARS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND RECURRENT PURPURA OF THE LEGS THEY HAVE POLYCLONAL INCREASE OF IG BUT NO INTERMEDIATE COMPLEXES DEMONSTRABLE BY ULTRACENTRIFUGATION THE PATIENTS DIFFER FROM OTHER PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS BY A RAPID DETERIORATION OF THE CLINICAL CONDITION AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMANENT PULMONARY INFECTION AND ALSO BY THEIR PRONENESS TO HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE INFECTIONS THE CLINICAL AND LABORATORY FINDINGS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF WALDENSTROM S HYPERGAMMAGLOBULINEMIC PURPURA THE HETEROGENEITY OF THIS SYNDROME IS DISCUSSED
785;PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF HAVE AN INCREASED CONCENTRATION OF SODIUM IN THEIR NAILS HITHERTO ONLY NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS HAS BEEN CONSIDERED FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS BY ANALYSIS OF ELECTROLYTES IN NAILS IT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED METHODOLOGICALLY AND CLINICALLY HOWEVER THE INTRINSIC ADVANTAGES OF X RAY MICROANALYSIS AND THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT THIS METHOD AFTER FURTHER TESTING MAY BE A USEFUL DIAGNOSTIC ACID FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN COMPARISON WITH NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS X RAY MICROANALYSIS HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF SIMULTANEOUSLY GIVING THE CONCENTRATIONS OF SEVERAL ELEMENTS AND MAY BE ACCESSIBLE AT ANY HOSPITAL WITH AN ELECTRON MICROSCOPE FITTED WITH THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT NAILS OF CF PATIENTS ARE HERE SHOWN TO HAVE INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS OF NA K AND CL WHICH WILL MAKE THE DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS MORE RELIABLE THE POSSIBILITY OF USING SULPHUR AS A REFERENCE ELEMENT MAY ELIMINATE THE WEIGHING PROCEDURE NECESSARY IN NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS
786;A DOUBLE BLIND STUDY HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF CAN BE RELIABLY DIAGNOSED WITH SKIN DERIVED FIBROBLAST CULTURES ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE AIP ACTIVITY HAS BEEN MEASURED IN NORMAL CONTROLS CF HETEROZYGOTES AND CF HOMOZYGOTES BEFORE AND AFTER STIMULATION WITH TAMM HORSFALL GLYCOPROTEIN THP ISOPROTERENOL AND THEOPHYLINE THP INDUCTION TEST THE MEAN AIP ACTIVITIES AFTER THP INDUCTION WERE AND FOR THE THREE DIFFERENT GENOTYPES RESPECTIVELY THERE WAS NO OVERLAP BETWEEN THE VALUES OF CF HOMOZYGOTES ON THE ONE HAND AND THE VALUES OF CF HETEROZYGOTES AND NORMAL CONTROLS ON THE OTHER HAND ALL SPECIMENS WERE CORRECTLY DIAGNOSED IN THE PRESENT DOUBLE BLIND STUDY INDICATING THE VERY HIGH DEGREE OF RELIABILITY OF THE THP INDUCTION TEST IN THE DETECTION OF THE PREDOMINANT TYPE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS WITH FIBROBLAST CULTURES NORMAL CONTROLS AND CF HETEROZYGOTES COULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS BUT AS A GROUP THE CF HETEROZYGOTES DISPLAYED HIGHER AIP VALUES
787;THREE CYSTIC FIBROSIS INFANTS WITH SEVERE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS HAD INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE WITH BULGING FONTANELS WHICH CLEARED PARRI PASSU WITH IMPROVEMENT IN THE CHEST CONDITION IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION IS A RESULT OF RAISED VENOUS PRESSURE ITSELF SECONDARY TO THE INTRATHORACIC OBSTRUCTION TO VENOUS RETURN CONSEQUENT ON THE BRONCHIAL OBSTRUCTIVE DISEASE
788;POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION OF A WEEK OLD POSTMENSTRUAL HUMAN FETUS DELIVERED BY CESAREAN SECTION REVEALED MECONIUM ILEUS AND MANY SWOLLEN MUCUS SECRETING CELLS IN THE GASTRO INTESTINAL MUCOSA THE PANCREAS SHOWED EXTENSIVE FIBROSIS ACINAR DESTRUCTION AND DILATATION OF DUCTS CONTAINING EOSINOPHILIC CASTS MUCOUS GLANDS OF THE LUNGS ALSO REVEALED MUCOUS CELLS SWOLLEN AND DISTENDED WITH THEIR SECRETORY PRODUCTS THE PATIENT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE CYSTIC FIBROSIS OF THE PANCREAS SUGGESTING THAT THE PATHOLOGIC MANIFESTATIONS OF THE DISEASE MAY BEGIN EARLY IN FETAL LIFE
789;THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWED THAT THE PANCREAS OF TWO MONKEY SPECIES CONTAINED SULPHATED BLOOD GROUP SUBSTANCE SUCH STRONGLY ANIONIC MOLECULES ARE KNOWN TO BIND CALCIUM AND THEIR SOLUTIONS FORM GELS IN THE PRESENCE OF CATIONS IT IS SUGGESTED THAT SUCH A MECHANISM MAY BE INVOLVED IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS
790;CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF PATIENTS CHRONICALLY INFECTED WITH MUCOID P AERUGINOSA AND PRESENTING MULTIPLE PRECIPITINS IN SERUM AGAINST THIS BACTERIUM AND PATIENTS WITHOUT P AERUGINOSA INFECTION WERE EXAMINED FOR OCCURRENCE OF SOLUBLE IMMUNE COMPLEXES IN THEIR SPUTUM SOL PHASE BY A COMPLEMENT CONSUMPTION ASSAY AND A SOLID PHASE RHEUMATOID FACTOR BINDING ASSAY THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE TWO ASSAYS WAS SIGNIFICANT R P LESS THAN THE PATIENTS CHRONICALLY INFECTED WITH P AERUGINOSA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANTLY P LESS THAN HIGHER FREQUENCY OF IMMUNE COMPLEX ACTIVITY IN THEIR SPUTUM SOL PHASE AS COMPARED TO THE PATIENTS WITHOUT P AERUGINOSA LUNG INFECTION THESE FINDINGS POINT TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT CHRONIC LUNG INFECTION WITH MUCOID P AERUGINOSA IN CF MAY BE AN IMMUNE COMPLEX DISEASE
791;NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PANCREAS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN THE NEONATE AND INFANT THIS REVIEW EVALUATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXOCRINE PANCREATIC FUNCTION THE HORMONAL CONTROL OF THIS FUNCTION THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF PANCREATIC ENZYMES AND PANCREATIC ADAPTATION TO FOOD THE FUNCTIONAL CHANGES THAT OCCUR IN DIFFERENT DISEASE PROCESSES OF THE PANCREAS AFFECTING THE INFANT WILL ALSO BE DISCUSSED SINCE THE TREATMENT OF PANCREATIC EXOCRINE INSUFFICIENCY WITH ORALLY ADMINISTERED PANCREATIC ENZYMES IN CHILDREN IS OFTEN MORE DIFFICULT THAN EXPECTED THE PRACTICAL APPROACH TO ENZYME TREATMENT WILL BE DISCUSSED THE MORPHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS OF THE PANCREAS TUMORS OF THE PANCREAS THE NORMAL FUNCTION OF THE EXOCRINE PANCREAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EXOCRINE PANCREATIC FUNCTION DEVELOPMENTAL ASPECTS OF AMYLASE ACTIVITY AND STARCH DIGESTION DIETARY ADAPTATION OF THE EXOCRINE PANCREAS PANCREATIC FUNCTION TESTS PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY CYSTIC FIBROSIS SHWACHMAN SYNDROME ISOLATED PANCREATIC ENZYME DEFICIENCIES THE TREATMENT OF EXOCRINE PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY PANCREATITIS IN CHILDHOOD AND THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE PANCREATITIS ARE DISCUSSED
792;TOTAL BODY OPACIFICATION IS THE PHENOMENON WHEREBY INTRODUCTION OF IODINATED CONTRAST MATERIAL INTO THE BLOOD STREAM RENDERS STRUCTURES DIFFERENTIALLY RADIOPAQUE ACCORDING TO THEIR BLOOD SUPPLY THE TERM IMPLIES THE PHYSIOLOGY IT IS THE WHOLE BODY WHICH IS OPACIFIED IN PROPORTION TO THE IODINE IN ITS PLASMA AND EXTRAVASCULAR EXTRACELLULAR FLUID AT THE TIME OF THE RADIOGRAPH TO THE DENSITY INHERENT IN THE TISSUE BEFORE INJECTION IS ADDED THE OPACITY OF THE IODINE CIRCULATING THROUGH AND TRANSUDING INTO IT JUST AS TISSUES EVEN THOSE OF WATER DENSITY HAVE MINOR INTRINSIC DIFFERENCES IN X RAY ABSORPTION SO THEY MAY ALSO HAVE MINOR DIFFERENCES IN BLOOD FLOW AND TRANSUDATION INTO THE EXTRACELLULAR FLUID THE COMBINATION OF THESE MINOR DIFFERENCES OFTEN MAKES THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE
793;IN PATIENTS WITH SVERE CHRONIC ASTHMA THE SWEAT CHLORIDE CL LEVEL WAS DETERMINED AND INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS WERE FOUND IN IN OF THE RELATIVES OF THESE PATIENTS INCREASED SWEAT CL LEVELS WERE ALSO FOUND THE AUTHORS GIVE DATA OF THEIR CLINICAL AND ALLERGY STUDY AND CONCLUDE THAT OF THE PATIENTS UNDER INVESTIGATION HAD CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ASTHMA ALLERGY AND A FUNCTIONAL EXOCRINE DISORDER THE EXOCRINOPATHY MAY BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CERTAIN TYPES OF ASTHMA
794;ZINC STATUS AND THE RETINOL TRANSPORT SYSTEM WERE EXAMINED IN RETINOL SUPPLEMENTED CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF PATIENTS AND AGE MATCHED CONTROLS PLASMA VITAMIN A WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE CF GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROLS AND CORRELATED POSITIVELY WITH PLASMA RETINOL BINDING PROTEIN RBP IN BOTH THE CF AND CONTROL GROUPS PLASMA ZINC OF THE CF GROUP WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN CONTROLS WHEREAS HAIR ZINC WAS PLASMA ZINC WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH PLASMA RBP VITAMIN A AND ALBUMIN IN THE CF GROUP BUT NOT IN THE CONTROLS PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF VITAMIN A RBP ALBUMIN AND ZINC DECREASED WITH AGE IN THE CF GROUP BUT NOT IN THE CONTROLS THE DATA SUPPORT PREVIOUS SUGGESTIONS THAT LOW PLASMA VITAMIN A LEVELS IN CF ARE DUE TO DEFECTS IN THE RETINOL TRANSPORT SYSTEM THE ZINC STATUS OF THE CF GROUPS AS A WHOLE WAS JUDGED TO BE LOW NORMAL HOWEVER A SUBGROUP OF CF PATIENTS WERE IN THE MARGINAL TO DEFICIENT CATEGORY THIS SUBGROUP ALSO HAD LOWER LEVELS OF PLASMA VITAMIN A AND RBP THE DATA SUGGEST THAT ZINC MAY BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THE LOW PLASMA VITAMIN A RBP LEVELS OF CF PATIENTS WITH MARGINAL OR DEFICIENT ZINC STATUS
795;A MODIFIED METHOD OF ANALYSIS OF SWEAT CHLORIDE CONCENTRATION WITH AN ION SELECTIVE ELECTRODE IS PRESENTED THE ORIGINAL METHOD OF SWEAT CHLORIDE ANALYSIS PROPOSED BY THE ORION RESEARCH CORPORATION CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS IS INADEQUATE BECAUSE IT PRODUCES ERRATIC AND MISLEADING RESULTS THE MODIFIED METHOD WAS COMPARED WITH THE REFERENCE QUANTITATIVE METHOD OF GIBSON AND COOKE IN THE MODIFIED METHOD INDIVIDUAL ELECTRODE PADS ARE CUT AND PLACED IN THE ELECTRODES RATHER THAN USING THE PADS SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY PILOCARPINE NITRATE MG L IS USED IN PLACE OF PILOCARPINE HCL MG L SODIUM BICARBONATE AS THE WEAK ELECTROLYTE IS USED INSTEAD OF K SO A MINUTE PERIOD FOR SWEAT ACCUMULATION IS EMPLOYED RATHER THAN A ZERO TIME COLLECTION AS IN THE ORIGINAL ORION METHOD THE MODIFICATION HAS BEEN STUDIED FOR REPRODUCIBILITY IN INDIVIDUALS REPRODUCIBILITY BETWEEN RIGHT AND LEFT ARM IN INDIVIDUALS IT HAS BEEN COMPARED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE QUANTITATIVE METHOD OF GIBSON AND COOKE BOTH IN NORMAL INDIVIDUALS AND IN PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS THERE IS EXCELLENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE MODIFIED METHOD AND THE QUANTITATIVE REFERENCE METHOD THERE APPEARS TO BE A SLIGHT BIAS TOWARD HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF CHLORIDE FROM THE RIGHT ARM COMPARED WITH THE LEFT ARM BUT THIS DIFFERENCE IS NOT MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT
796;THE MECONIUM PLUG SYNDROME MPS IS A COMMON CAUSE OF LOW INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION IN NEWBORN INFANTS USUALLY IT IS BENIGN AND NOT ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER INTESTINAL DYSFUNCTION WE DESCRIBE THE CASES OF THREE INFANTS IN WHOM THERE WAS INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION CONSISTENT WITH THE MPS AND IN WHICH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF WAS LATER DOCUMENTED WE SUGGEST THAT THERE IS AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE MPS AND CF AND THAT THE CONDITION OF ALL INFANTS WITH THE MPS BE EVALUATED FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF BOTH HIRSCHSPRUNG S DISEASE AND CF
797;HYPOPROTEINEMIA AND EDEMA MAY DEVELOP IN INFANTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WHATEVER THEIR DIET ALTHOUGH PRIOR INGESTION OF SOY BEAN FORMULA APPEARS TO BE A PREDISPOSING FACTOR AND A NEGATIVE SWEAT CHLORIDE TEST MAY BE PRESENT IN A CF CHILD DURING THE HYPOPROTEINEMIC PHASE OF THE ILLNESS THE DIAGNOSIS CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNTIL A NEGATIVE TEST WITH ADEQUATE SECRETION OF SWEAT IS OBTAINED AFTER EDEMA AND HYPOPROTEINEMIA HAVE RESOLVED
798;WE HAVE OBSERVED SEVERE MECONIUM PLUG SYNDROME MPS IN A NEWBORN INFANT WHO WAS FOUND DURING THE NEONATAL PERIOD TO HAVE EXTENSIVE EXOCRINE PANCREATIC DEFICIENCY CYSTIC FIBROSIS WAS EXCLUDED BY SEVERAL SWEAT CHLORIDE TESTS OUR OBSERVATION OF MPS IN A PATIENT WITH EXOCRINE PANCREATIC DEFICIENCY SUGGESTS THAT THE MPS OBSERVED IN THE CF PATIENTS REPORTED BY ROSENSTEIN IS PROBABLY CAUSED BY PANCREATIC DEFICIENCY THE FREQUENT OCCURRENCE OF MECONIUM ILEUS MI IN CF AND THE RARITY OF MPS IN CF IS CURIOUS SINCE THEY MAY BE DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SAME PATHOLOGIC PROCESS CONCEIVABLY MPS MAY OCCUR WITH TOTAL ABSENCE OF PANCREATIC ENZYMES AS IN OUR PATIENT AND IN A FEW PATIENTS WITH CF LOW LEVELS OF ENZYMES IN CF MAY LIMIT EXPRESSION TO MECONIUM ILEUS WE WISH TO SUGGEST THE EVALUATION OF EXOCRINE PANCREATIC FUNCTION IN THESE PATIENTS EVEN IF CF HAS BEEN EXCLUDED BY SWEAT TESTS THERE IS CONFLICTING ALBEIT FRAGMENTARY DATA SUGGESTING THAT EXOCRINE PANCREATIC DEFICIENCY MAY NOT BE THE SOLE CAUSE OF MECONIUM OBSTRUCTION IN CF SEVERAL INVESTIGATORS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT MI MAY BE THE RESULT OF ABNORMAL PROTEIN AND MUCOPROTEIN SECRETIONS BY THE INTESTINAL GOBLET CELLS AND NOT FROM LACK OF PANCREATIC ENZYMES ALONE WHILE THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT EXOCRINE PANCREATIC DEFICIENCY MAY NOT PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN ALL INSTANCE OF MECONIUM OBSTRUCTION IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE MAY BE LITTLE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE HISTOLOGIC APPEARANCE OF THE PANCREAS AND EXOCRINE FUNCTION
799;A CASE OF MECONIUM ILEUS EQUIVALENT IN A YEAR OLD MAN IS PRESENTED THE PATHOLOGY AND THERAPY FOR THE CONDITION ARE DISCUSSED
800;THE COMBINATION OF TICARCILLIN PLUS TOBRAMYCIN TT OR CARBENICILLIN PLUS GENTAMICIN CG WAS USED TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE SYSTEMIC GRAM NEGATIVE INFECTION IN A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED STUDY PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA WAS THE PRIMARY PATHOGEN IN PER CENT OF THESE PATIENTS PATIENTS TREATED WITH TT RESPONDED MORE FREQUENTLY PER CENT OR OF THAN PATIENTS TREATED WITH CG PER CENT OR OF P IS LESS THAN THIS DIFFERENCE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A GREATER RESPONSE TO TT IN PATIENTS WITH PULMONARY INFECTIONS PER CENT VERSUS PER CENT AND INFECTIONS DUE TO PSEUDOMONAS PER CENT VERSUS PER CENT SEVERITY OF UNDERLYING DISEASE WAS ALSO AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF RESPONSE EXCEPT FOR A GREATER INCIDENCE OF HEPATOTOXICITY WITH CG PER CENT VERSUS PER CENT P IS LESS THAN THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN TOXICITY COLONIZATION WITH DRUG RESISTANT MICROORGANISMS OR SUPERINFECTION BETWEEN THE TWO TREATMENT GROUPS THE COMBINATION OF TT APPEARS TO BE SUPERIOR TO CG FOR THE TREATMENT OF PULMONARY INFECTIONS DUE TO PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA
801;FETAL OR NEONATAL VOLVULUS IS A RARE EVENT AND IS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH AN ANATOMIC DEFECT MASSIVE ABDOMINAL DISTENSION SECONDARY TO A RUPTURED OR UNRUPTURED VOLVULUS HAS NEVER BEEN REPORTED AS A CAUSE OF OBSTRUCTED LABOR THE PRESENT REPORT DOCUMENTS SUCH A CASE SECONDARY TO CHEMICAL PERITONITIS RESULTING FROM A RUPTURED MIDGUT VOLVULUS THIS CASE DEMONSTRATES AN UNUSUAL PRESENTATION OF PRESUMED CYSTIC FIBROSIS WITH MECONIUM ILEUS AND VOLVULUS WHICH LED TO ISCHEMIC INFARCTION AND PERFORATION OF THE SMALL BOWEL THIS CASE LIKEWISE EMPHASIZES THE NEED TO CONSIDER THE PRESENCE OF OTHER FETAL ANOMALIES SUCH AS OMPHALOCELE OR GASTROSCHISIS WHEN THE USUAL MANEUVERS FAIL TO RELIEVE SHOULDER DYSTOCIA
802;BY IN VITRO TESTS ON STRAINS OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA SPUTUM FROM PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS SHARPLY INCREASED THE MINIMAL BACTERICIDAL CONCENTRATIONS OF POLYMYXIN B AND NEOMYCIN SPUTUM HAD A LESSER EFFECT ON TESTS WITH GENTAMICIN AND TOBRAMYCIN AND ESSENTIALLY NONE ON TESTS WITH CARBENICILLIN
803;NINE PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS BUT WITHOUT DIGITAL CLUBBING GROUP A WERE MATCHED PROSPECTIVELY BY SEX AND APPROXIMATE AGE TO CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS WITH DIGITAL CLUBBING GROUP B AND TO NORMAL PERSONS CONTROL SUBJECTS PATIENTS IN GROUP B HAD SIGNIFICANTLY P LESS THAN LOWER CLINICAL SCORES AND FORCED VITAL CAPACITY THAN DID THOSE IN GROUP A INDICATING MORE SEVERE PULMONARY DISEASE IN THE FORMER HOWEVER OTHER SPIROMETER TESTS OF PULMONARY FUNCTION REVEALED NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS A AND B THE DEGREE OF DIGITAL CLUBBING HAD SIGNIFICANT P LESS THAN LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS TO FORCED VITAL CAPACITY R AND CLINICAL SCORES R FOR GROUPS A AND B PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF PROSTAGLANDINS F ALPHA AND E WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED P LESS THAN IN BOTH GROUP A X SE AND NG PER ML RESPECTIVELY AND GROUP B X SE AND NG PER ML RESPECTIVELY COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP X SE AND NG PER ML RESPECTIVELY GROUP B HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER CONCENTRATIONS THAN DID GROUP A HOWEVER PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF PROSTAGLANDIN KETO DIHYDRO METABOLITE WERE NOT DIFFERENT IN GROUPS A AND B AND WERE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP THESE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE DEGREE OF DIGITAL CLUBBING IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS RELATED TO THE SEVERITY OF THE PULMONARY INVOLVEMENT AND THAT THE PROSTAGLANDIN SYSTEM MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS DISEASE
804;MASSIVE HEMOPTYSIS VOLUME OF EXPECTORATED BLOOD ML IN HOURS OCCURRED IN PER CENT OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS TWENTY TWO OF THE PATIENTS WERE IN THE MIDST OF A RELATIVELY LONG LASTING FLARE UP OF PULMONARY INFECTION THERE WAS NO OTHER CONSISTENT PRECIPITATING EVENT ALL BUT OF THE PATIENTS WERE ADMITTED AFTER THE INITIAL EPISODE AND WERE TREATED WITH PARENTERAL ANTIMICROBIAL DRUGS POSTURAL DRAINAGE WAS RESUMED AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER CESSATION OF ACUTE BLEEDING VITAMIN K WAS ADMINISTERED TO ALL PATIENTS VOLUMES OF EXPECTORATED BLOOD WERE AS LARGE AS ML WITH THE INITIAL EPISODE BLOOD PRESSURE CHANGES OCCURRED IN PATIENTS FIVE PATIENTS RECEIVED BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS BLEEDING STOPPED WITHOUT SURGICAL INTERVENTION IN ALL PATIENTS USUALLY WITHIN DAYS THE PATIENTS HAD A TOTAL OF EPISODES OF BLEEDING NO SURGICAL TREATMENT WAS UNDERTAKEN AT THIS CENTER ONE PATIENT UNDERWENT A LOBECTOMOY AT ANOTHER HOSPITAL BUT CONTINUED TO BLEED POSTOPERATIVELY TEN PATIENTS DIED MEAN SURVIVAL AFTER HEMOPTYSIS YEARS RANGE MONTHS TO YEARS THIS SURVIVAL RATE IS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF ANOTHER GROUP OF PATIENTS WITH EQUALLY SEVERE LUNG DISEASE WHO HAD NEVER BLED PROFUSELY THE OTHER PATIENTS REMAIN ALIVE FROM MONTHS TO YEARS AFTER THEIR INITIAL EPISODE OUR DAT SUGGEST THAT MASSIVE HEMOPTYSIS COMPLICATING CYSTIC FIBROSIS MAY NOT BE AS OMINOUS AN EVENT AS HAS BEEN BELIEVED IN THE PAST BECAUSE OF THE TENDENCY OF MOST PATIENTS TO STOP BLEEDING WITHOUT AGGRESSIVE SURGICAL INTERVENTION FUTURE STUDIES OF NEW THERAPEUTIC MEASURES FOR MASSIVE HEMOPTYSIS MUST HAVE APPROPRIATE UNTREATED CONTROL PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE ONLY MEDICAL MANAGEMENT

817;SCREENING OF SWEAT CHLORIDE IN NEWBORN INFANTS WITH THE ORION SKIN CHLORIDE MEASURING SYSTEM AND INCORPORATING SOME PROCEDURAL INNOVATIONS IS DESCRIBED THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT WHILE DIAGNOSTIC SCREENING FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS CAN BE READILY UNDERTAKEN THE TEST WITH THE CHLORIDE ION SELECTIVE ELECTRODE IS BEST LEFT AT LEAST TO THE SECOND DAY OF LIFE OR LATER BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT SWEATING IN VERY YOUNG BABIES MEASUREMENTS ON BABIES WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED
818;BRAY ET AL CONCLUDE THAT THE MASS SCREENING OF NEWBORN BABIES WITH CHLORIDE ION SELECTIVE ELECTRODES IS A FEASIBLE METHOD FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS THEY ALSO SUGGEST THAT THIS PROCEDURE MIGHT BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MECONIUM ANALYSIS TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF FALSE POSITIVE RESULTS IN WE REPORTED THE DETAILS OF A CHILD WITH PROVED CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN WHOM RAISED SWEAT SODIUM BUT NORMAL SWEAT CHLORIDE LEVELS WERE OBTAINED DURING TREATMENT WITH CLOXACILLIN ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO THE IMPLICATION OF THE FINDING WITH REGARD TO SCREENING PROCEDURES AND THE SUGGESTION WAS MADE THAT IN AT LEAST SOME CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS THE CLOXACILLIN RADICAL MIGHT REPLACE THE CHLORIDE ION IN THE SWEAT WHEN MASS SCREENING FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS TO BE UNDERTAKEN USING METHODS BASED ON THE ESTIMATION OF SWEAT CHLORIDE LEVELS IT IS THEREFORE PRUDENT TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE INFANT IS RECEIVING MEDICATION FROM ANY SOURCE AND IF SO TO INTERPRET THE RESULTS WITH CAUTION THESE ARE INSTANCES OF FALSE NEGATIVE SWEAT CHLORIDE READINGS BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE YET FROM OUR TESTS OF ANY NEGATIVE CYSTIC FIBROSIS SWEAT CHLORIDE THE STATISTICAL CHANCE OF THIS IS IN ANY CASE SMALL THESE SEVERAL CASES SUGGEST A NEED FOR A SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF MEDICATION ON SWEAT ION LEVELS IN GENERAL AS WELL AS IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS CASES
819;IN A SURVEY OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF IN THE AVON AREA CHILDREN WITH CF FROM FAMILIES TOGETHER WITH OF THEIR PARENTS WERE STUDIED BY SPIROMETRY EXERCISE TESTS AND PINCH TESTS A CONTROL GROUP OF YOUNG ADULTS WAS SIMILARLY TESTED CONTROL DATA FOR CHILDREN WERE TAKEN FROM PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED WORK THE PREVALENCE OF ATOPY ANY POSITIVE PRICK TEST IN CHILDREN WITH CF WAS SENSITIVITY TO GRASS POLLENS AND HOUSE DUST MITE WAS NO MORE COMMON IN THESE CHILDREN THAN IN A NORMAL POPULATION HYPERSENSITIVITY TO ASPERGILLUS FUMIGATUS WAS FOUND IN OF CHILDREN WITH CF AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERE LUNG DISEASE THE PARENTS HAD A NORMAL PATTERN AND PREVALENCE OF ATOPY EXERCISE INDUCED AIRWAYS OBSTRUCTION WAS PRESENT IN ONLY OF CHILDREN WITH CF ITS ASSOCIATION WITH SEVERE LUNG DISEASE RENDERED INTERPRETATION DIFFICULT THE PARENTS HAD A NORMAL RESPONSE TO EXERCISE BOTH HYPERSENSITIVITY TO A FUMIGATUS AND EXERCISE INDUCED AIRWAYS LABILITY HAD THE FEATURES OF ACQUIRED CHARACTERISTICS THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE PRESENT STUDY TO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE POSSESSION OF A CF GENE PREDISPOSED TO ATOPY

821;DURING THE LAST TWO DECADES GREAT STRIDES HAVE BEEN MADE IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS OF AIRFLOW IN THE PERIPHERY OF THE LUNG IT SEEMS THAT THE SMALL AIRWAYS ARE THE IMPORTANT SITE OF OBSTRUCTION IN A VARIETY OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH AIRFLOW OBSTRUCTION THIS REVIEW DEALS WITH THE ANATOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS OF SMALL AIRWAYS IN NORMAL AND DISEASED LUNGS IN PARTICULAR THE BASIS OF OBSTRUCTION OR NARROWING THAT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON INTRINSIC AIRWAY LESION IS REVIEWED THE VARIETY OF PATHOLOGIC CHANGES IN SMALL AIRWAYS OBSERVED IN THESE DISEASES ARE OUTLINED ALONG WITH PHYSIOLOGIC TESTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY USED TO DETECT DYSFUNCTION AT A STAGE LONG BEFORE THEY PRODUCE SYMPTOMS OR ALTER STANDARD TESTS OF LUNG FUNCTION
822;CYSTIC FIBROSIS AN AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE DISORDER REMAINS THE MOST COMMON LETHAL GENETIC DISEASE OF CAUCASIAN PEOPLE THE DIAGNOSIS OF CF IS USUALLY MADE BASED UPON THE CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY AND OR GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS A POSITIVE SWEAT ELECTROLYTE TEST AND OFTEN A FAMILY HISTORY OF THE DISORDER THE MANIFESTATIONS OF CHRONIC COUGH RECURRENT PNEUMONIAS BRONCHIECTASIS WITH CLUBBING PNEUMOTHORAX HEMOPTYSIS AND MALABSORPTION SECONDARY TO PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY ARE SO WELL ASSOCIATED WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS THAT THE DIAGNOSIS IS USUALLY NOT DELAYED HOWEVER IT IS OFTEN NOT APPRECIATED BY PHYSICIANS THAT CF MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A BROAD SPECTRUM OF LESS COMMON MANIFESTATIONS AS WELL AS EXTREME VARIABILITY IN SEVERITY OF ILLNESS LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THESE MANIFESTATIONS MAY DELAY DIAGNOSIS UNTIL ADOLESCENCE OR ADULTHOOD FIRST THERE SEEMS TO BE MILD CLINICAL EXPRESSION OF THE DISORDER IN SOME PATIENTS GENETIC VARIABILITY SECOND THE SUBTLE MANIFESTATIONS OF CF ARE NOT WIDELY APPRECIATED BY PHYSICIANS IN PRACTICE
823;FIVE CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WERE GIVEN REPEATED INTRAVENOUS INFUSIONS OF SOYA OIL EMULSION INTRALIPID FOR TO MONTHS AND THE EFFECTS ON GROWTH HEALTH SWEAT CHLORIDE AND PANCREATIC ENZYME ACTIVITY COMPARED WITH A CONTROL GROUP NO BENEFICIAL EFFECT WAS DEMONSTRATED AND IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS FORM OF THERAPY HAS NO PLACE IN THE ROUTINE TREATMENT OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT TREATMENT MAY HAVE MODIFIED THE DEGREE OF WEIGHT LOSS NOTED AFTER MONTHS OF AGE THE LACK OF OTHER BENEFICIAL EFFECTS AND THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN LONG TERM INTRALIPID INFUSION SHOULD PRECLUDE THE USE OF THIS FORM OF THERAPY IN THE ROUTINE TREATMENT OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS
824;CONTROVERSY STILL SURROUNDS THE MOST APPROPRIATE METHOD OF MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS THE REASON FOR MUCH OF THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT MANAGEMENT OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS THAT MANY THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED WITHOUT PROPERLY CONDUCTED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH THE CURRENT APPROACHES TO THERAPY AT LEAST OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CAN EXPECT TO REACH ADULT LIFE MOST WITH MINIMAL OR NO LUNG DAMAGE HOWEVER THIS DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN SURVIVAL DOES NOT INDICATE THAT CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS NOW AN EASY CONDITION TO MANAGE AND THAT IT NO LONGER REQUIRES SPECIALISED CARE
825;SWEAT TESTS COLLECTED ON TWO OR MORE OCCASIONS FROM NORMAL CHILDREN AND CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAVE BEEN ANALYSED ACCORDING TO THE WEIGHT OF SWEAT COLLECTED IN FIVE CASES COLLECTIONS OF MG OF SWEAT GAVE FALSE NEGATIVE RESULTS ALTHOUGH MG OF SWEAT IS CONSIDERED ADEQUATE BY SOME AUTHORITIES OUR RESULTS DO NOT SUPPORT THIS THE STUDY CONFIRMS THE VIEW THAT AT LEAST MG OF SWEAT MUST BE COLLECTED TO GIVE RELIABLE RESULTS

828;WE HAVE STUDIED THE PLASIM ALPHA MACROGLOBULIN INTERACTION USING PLASMA FROM CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS IN THIS SYSTEM ALPHA MACROGLOBULIN FROM CYSTIC FIBROSIS PLASMA DOES NOT DIFFER FROM CONTROLS IN ITS ABILITY TO BIND WITH AND INHIBIT PLASMIN
829;A TWO FOLD INCREASE IN CA LABELING WAS OBSERVED WHEN NORMAL HUMAN LEUKOCYTES WERE INCUBATED IN THE PRESENCE OF SERUM OBTAINED FROM PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS THE DEGREE OF CA LABELING OF LEUKOCYTES ISOLATED FROM PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THAT OBSERVED FOR LEUKOCYTES THAT HAD BEEN ISOLATED FROM NORMAL INDIVIDUALS
830;CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS AN AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE DISEASE USUALLY FATAL BEFORE THE THIRD DECADE CHARACTERIZED BY CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE ELEVATED SWEAT ELECTROLYTE CONCENTRATIONS AND PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE IF P TYPE SERUM RNASE ACTIVITY WAS REDUCED IN CF PATIENTS TO YEARS OF AGE NO DIFFERENCE IN SERUM RNASE ACTIVITY WAS FOUND AMONG THE GROUPS OF NORMALS CF PATIENTS AND CF HETEROZYGOTES IT APPEARS THAT OBSERVATIONS OF DECREASED RNASE ACTIVITY IN THE SERUM OF YOUNG CHILDREN WITH PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY CANNOT BE EXTENDED TO OLDER CHILDREN AT LEAST WITHOUT WITHHOLDING PANCREATIC SUPPLEMENTS
831;THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES OF ALPHA D MANNOSIDASE BETA GLUCURONIDASE BETA D FUCOSIDASE ACID AND ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE WERE STUDIED IN MECONIUM FROM INFANTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF AND CONTROL SUBJECTS THE STUDY REVEALED SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITY OF THE ENZYMES EXCEPT FOR ACID PHOSPHATASE THE VARIATIONS WERE NOT UNIFORM THE ACTIVITIES OF ALPHA D MANNOSIDASE BETA GLUCURONIDASE AND ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE WERE MARKEDLY DECREASED P LESS THAN P LESS THAN P LESS THAN RESPECTIVELY WHILE THE ACTIVITY OF BETA D FUCOSIDASE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED P LESS THAN IN MECONIUM FROM THE INFANTS WITH CF IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE DECREASED ACTIVITY OF ALPHA D MANNOSIDASE AND BETA GLUCURONIDASE MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE ACCUMULATION OF THE ABNORMAL SUBSTANCES IN CF MECONIUM THE HIGHLY INCREASED ACTIVITY OF BETA D FUCOSIDASE RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ADDITIONAL OR ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR SCREENING NEWBORNS FOR CF USING MECONIUM AS THE TEST MATERIAL
832;THE FACT THAT A SERUM FACTOR IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS INHIBITS CILIARY MOVEMENT OF CELLS OF ISOLATED TRACHEAE AND THE OBSERVATION THAT CILIARY MOVEMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH PINOCYTOTIC ACTIVITY LED OHNO ET AL TO SUGGEST THAT THIS DEFECT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR APLASIA OR HYPOPLASIA OF THE WOLFFIAN DUCT STRUCTURES IN MALES WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WHILE OHNO S HYPOTHESIS LACKS DEFINITIVE PROOF THE HYPOPLASIA OR APLASIA OF THE VAS IN MALES WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS EXTREMELY COMMON PRODUCING STERILITY IN AFFECTED MALES

929;PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAVE A HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF SODIUM AND CHLORIDE IN THEIR SWEAT THAN NORMALS THIS OBSERVATION LED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF AN IONTOPHORESIS TECHNIQUE FOR STIMULATING THE SWEAT GLANDS WITH PILOCARPINE OCCASIONALLY ELECTRICAL BURNS RESULT FROM DEFECTIVE EQUIPMENT OR FROM AN INCORRECT OR BADLY APPLIED TEST PROCEDURE A NEW DESIGN OF EQUIPMENT IS PRESENTED WHICH ELIMINATES THE POSSIBILITY OF A BURN DURING THE TEST
930;MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO ESTABLISH A SUITABLE SCREENING TEST FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS FOR NEWBORNS RECENTLY A NEW METHOD HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY CROSSLEY AND HER ASSOCIATES IT IS BASED ON MEASURING PANCREATIC TRYPSIN IN A SAMPLE OF FAECES COLLECTED ON TO FILTER PAPER ON THE TH OR TH DAY OF LIFE THE FALSE NEGATIVE RATE OF THE NEW TEST HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED BUT OLDER CHILDREN WITH CF AND PANCREATIC ACHYLIA ALL GAVE ABNORMAL RESULTS WHEN TESTED THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE TEST AS WITH THE MECONIUM ALBUMIN TEST IS THAT ABOUT OF CHILDREN WITH CF ARE SAID NOT TO HAVE PANCREATIC ACHYLIA WHILST THE METHOD NEEDS MORE EXTENSIVE EVALUATION IT APPEARS TECHNICALLY MORE SATISFACTORY THAN OTHERS SO FAR DESCRIBED
931;WE HAVE MEASURED FAST MOVING COMPONENTS OF HAEMOGLOBIN FMH IN NINE CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WITHOUT ANY CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF DIABETES MELLITUS THE NINE PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAD A MEAN FMH OF WHICH DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CONTROLS WITH A MEAN FMH OF THERE WAS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN FMH AND AGE OR FMH AND DURATION OF DISEASE THE ABOVE RESULTS RAISE THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT EXTENT THE FMH IS A REFLECTION OF HYPERGLYCAEMIA OR INSULINOPENIA
933;MALABSORPTION IN INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD CAN ROUGHLY BE DEFINED AS A CONDITION OF INADEQUATE GROWTH IN SPITE OF SEEMINGLY ADEQUATE NUTRITION AND IS ACCOMPANIED BY EXCESSIVE EXCRETION OF FOOD COMPONENTS IN THE STOOLS ACQUIRED LACTASE DEFICIENCY THE INTRODUCTION OF SUGAR IN THE DIET COELIAC DISEASE AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS ARE DISCUSSED
934;LONG CONSIDERED A CHILDHOOD DISEASE CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IN ADULTS IN THE CASE REPORTED BELOW THE DIAGNOSIS WAS MADE IN AN ADULT THE INITIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN PATIENTS OVER YEARS OF AGE HAS RARELY BEEN REPORTED OUR PATIENT IN WHOM THE DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS WAS FIRST MADE AT YEARS IF AGE SERVES TO EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT PHYSICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ADULTS WITH UNEXPLAINED CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
935;THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF PERSONS AT HIGH RISK FOR PIGMENT GALLSTONES DIFFER FROM THOSE IS WHOM CHOLESTEROL STONES ARE LIKELY TO DEVELOP CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PIGMENT GALLSTONES INCLUDE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA ALCOHOLIC CIRRHOSIS AND INFECTED BILE CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CHOLESTEROL GALLSTONES INCLUDE OBESITY DIET BLOOD CHOLESTEROL LOWERING DRUGS DISORDERS OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT FEMALE SEX HORMONES AND GENETIC AND ETHNIC INFLUENCES PROBLEM AREAS SUCH AS CASE FINDING AND COMMON DISORDERS AND PREGNANCY ARE DISCUSSED ALONG WITH CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS DIAGNOSIS PREVENTION AND THERAPY
936;IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT MOST CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS LACK AN ALPHA MACROGLOBULIN PROTEASE COMPLEX AND THAT BINDING OF TRYPSIN AND OTHER PROTEASES TO ALPHA MACROGLOBULIN IS LOWER IN PLASMA OF CF PATIENTS THAN IN THAT OF NORMAL CONTROLS WE THEREFORE DECIDED TO STUDY THE INTERACTION OF TRYPSIN WITH PLASMA PROTEINS OF CF PATIENTS HERE WE REPORT THAT TRYPSIN BINDING IGG TBIGG IS PRESENT IN OF CF PATIENTS AND IN OF THEIR MOTHERS BUT NOT IN OF NORMAL CONTROLS OR IN OTHER RELATIVES OF CF PATIENTS EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE ANTIBODY NATURE OF TBIGG WHICH IS PRESUMABLY PRODUCED AGAINST THE PORCINE TRYPSIN INGESTED BY CF PATIENTS AS PANCREATIC EXTRACTS FOR SUBSTITUTIVE ENZYME THERAPY
937;CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS A COMMON AND SERIOUS DISEASE AND PRESENTS A CHALLENGE IN MANAGEMENT TO THE PAEDIATRICIAN NURSE DIETITIAN PHYSIOTHERAPIST AND ALL OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CARING TEAM THE OUTSTANDING RESEARCH CHALLENGE IS TO DISCOVER THE BASIC DEFECT AND IF THIS IS NOT TREATABLE TO FIND A METHOD OF IDENTIFYING CARRIERS AND AFFECTED INFANTS IN UTERO IN THIS TASK THE WORK OF THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS RESEARCH TRUST BOTH IN RAISING MONEY FOR RESEARCH AND FOR SUPPORTING AND ADVISING PATIENTS IS MUCH APPRECIATED
938;THE AUTHORS EXPLAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF NURSING CARE BEING DIRECTED TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS CHILD AND IN PARTICULAR THE MOTHER
940;THE AUTHOR EXPLAINS WHY TREATMENT ALTHOUGH TIME CONSUMING MUST BE CARRIED OUT EVERY DAY
941;THE CHILD WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS PRESENTS A HEART BREAKING PROBLEM TO PARENTS SINCE THE DISEASE IS INHERITED EQUALLY FROM BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER AND THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT OTHER CHILDREN WILL BE SIMILARLY AFFLICTED PERHAPS THE MOST VALUABLE ADVICE THE NURSE CAN GIVE TO PARENTS IS TO ADOPT AT ALL TIMES A POSITIVE APPROACH TO THEIR PROBLEM
942;CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS A FATAL INHERITED DISEASE INVOLVING MANY DIFFERENT ORGANS AT ONE TIME MOST AFFECTED CHILDREN DIED WITHIN A FEW YEARS OF BIRTH BUT MODERN MANAGEMENT HAS LED TO A MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN PROGNOSIS AND OF COURSE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF AFFECTED OLDER CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS THEREFORE NO LONGER A DISEASE ENCOUNTERED ONLY IN PAEDIATRIC UNITS BUT WITH INCREASING SURVIVAL INTO TEENS AND TWENTIES AFFECTED PATIENTS ARE NOW APPEARING IN ADULT UNITS THE AETIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY THE CLINICAL PICTURE DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS ARE DISCUSSED
943;WHAT WILL BE OUR GI APPROACH TO A CHILD WITH FTT SYNDROME DETAILED HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION WILL GIVE US THE CLUE AND OFTEN THE PROBABLE DIAGNOSIS SEVERAL LABORATORY TESTS ARE HELPFUL IN ESTABLISHING THE FACT THAT THERE IS MALABSORPTION AMONG THEM ARE A COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT WITH SMEAR QUANTITATIVE STOOL FAT EXCRETION SERUM PROTEIN AND CHEMISTRY SCREEN PANEL PROTHROMBIN TIME AND ORAL TOLERANCE AND ABSORPTION I E OF GLUCOSE IRON VITAMIN A AND XYLOSE SPECIALIZED PROCEDURES MAY BE USED TO NAIL DOWN THE DIAGNOSIS RADIOLOGY BIOPSY DUODENAL INTUBATION ETC THESE SHOULD NEVER BE EMPLOYED AS ROUTINE SCREENING TESTS HOWEVER IN OUTLINING A COMPREHENSIVE AND SUCCESSFUL THERAPY THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN WILL FIND IT HELPFUL TO CONSIDER THE PARTICULAR PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS OF A SPECIFIC DISEASE EXACT DIAGNOSIS MAKES THE THERAPY BOTH RATIONAL AND EFFECTIVE
944;CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS THE MOST COMMON LETHAL GENETIC DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD AND THE BROAD RANGE OF ITS CLINICAL EXPRESSION CAN INVOLVE PRACTICALLY EVERY SPECIALTY OF MEDICINE THE PATHOLOGY OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS ITS CLINICAL FEATURES DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT ARE DISCUSSED THE PEDIATRICIAN WILL NOT WANT TO ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE EXCLUSIVE CARE FOR THE CF PATIENT THESE PATIENTS REQUIRE THE MANY SUPPORTS THAT ONLY A SPECIALIZED CENTER WILL HAVE CHEST SURGEONS PEDIATRIC SURGEONS OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS CARDIOLOGISTS GASTROENTEROLOGISTS IN FACT ALL FIELDS OF MEDICINE AND ALL MEDICAL SPECIALTIES MAY BE NEEDED FOR THE VARIOUS CLINICAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISEASE
945;MODERN ADVANCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND IN CHEMOTHERAPY HAVE MADE AVAILABLE POTENT AMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS WITH MORE EFFECTIVE ONES TO COME THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AGAINST P AERUGINOSA IS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND OTHER CHRONIC DISORDERS THE DEVELOPMENT OF CARBENICILLIN HAS AUGMENTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS TICARCILLIN IS SIMILAR TO CARBENICILLIN AND WILL PLAY A SIMILAR ROLE IN ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY THE CEPHALOSPORINS SERVE AS ALTERNATIVE AGENTS PRINCIPALLY FOR THEIR ANTISTAPHYLOCOCCAL ACTIVITY WE ARE URGENTLY IN NEED OF A POTENT ANTIBIOTIC AGENT AGAINST P AERUGINOSA THAT CAN BE GIVEN BY THE ORAL ROUTE THE TMP SMX COMBINATION IS A POTENT CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT THAT CAN BE ADMINISTERED BY THE ORAL ROUTE IT IS EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF P CARINII PNEUMONIA WHICH IS VERY COMMON OWING TO THE EXTENDED SURVIVAL OF PATIENTS WITH LEUKEMIA AND OTHER MALIGNANCIES OR WITH ALLOGRAFTS WHO ARE PRONE TO DEVELOP INFECTIONS WITH IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY
946;IN OUR HANDS THE BMC TEST MECONIUM HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING AN IDEAL NEWBORN SCREENING TEST FOR CF IT IS EASILY PERFORMED IS HIGHLY SPECIFIC HAS REASONABLY HIGH SENSITIVITY AND GIVEN ITS LIMITATION OF IDENTIFYING ONLY PATIENTS WITH CF WHO HAVE INTRAUTERINE PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY IS THE BEST METHOD OF SCREENING NEWBORNS FOR CF THAT HAS BEEN DEVISED TO DATE MANY TECHNICAL PROBLEMS REMAIN TO BE SOLVED BEFORE THE TEST CAN BE ENDORSED WITHOUT RESERVATION BECAUSE THE TEST AS CURRENTLY CONSTITUTED DOES NOT IDENTIFY ALL POTENTIAL SUBJECTS FOR FURTHER TESTING WHO MIGHT HAVE CF IT SHOULD NOT BE MADE MANDATORY IT IS HOWEVER BETTER THAN OTHER AVAILABLE SCREENING METHODS FOR CF AND CAN BE PRAISED FOR THAT BENEFIT THE CONCEPT HAS INDICATED A VALUABLE NEW DIRECTION FOR MASS SCREENING POSSIBILITIES AND PERHAPS CAN BY FUTURE MODIFICATION BE MADE SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO WARRANT UNIVERSAL USAGE
947;THE WIDTH OF THE RIGHT PARATRACHEAL STRIPE RPS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN NORMAL ADULTS BUT NOT IN NORMAL CHILDREN THE THYMUS AND GREAT VESSELS ARE RELATIVELY LARGER IN CHILDREN THAN IN ADULTS AND COULD OBSCURE OR WIDEN THE RPS WE FOUND THAT OBSCURATION DOES OCCUR AND THEREFORE THE RPS IS LESS OFTEN MEASURABLE IN CHILDREN THAN IN ADULTS WIDENING BY THE THYMUS AND GREAT VESSELS HOWEVER DOES NOT OCCUR THE WIDTH OF THE RPS IN NORMAL CHILDREN TO MM IS SLIGHTLY LESS THAN IN ADULTS FROM THIS STUDY OF NORMAL CHILDREN AND OUR SUBSEQUENT EXPERIENCE WITH PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WE CONCLUDE THAT IN A CHILD AN RPS MM OR WIDER IS RELIABLE EVIDENCE OF DISEASE AFFECTING THE TRACHEA MEDIASTINUM OR PLEURA
948;A YEAR OLD WHITE GIRL WHO DEVELOPED FATAL COR PULMONALE FROM SEVERE PULMONARY SARCOIDOSIS HAD A PREVIOUS CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS CHEST RADIOGRAPHS DEMONSTRATED MARKED PULMONARY FIBROSIS WITHOUT THE CHANGES OF SEVERE BRONCHIECTASIS THAT WOULD BE ANTICIPATED WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS

1115;CYSTIC FIBROSIS AS A SPECIFIC DISEASE ENTITY HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MALNUTRITION FOR ALMOST HALF A CENTURY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MALNUTRITION IN THE DISEASE PROCESS REMAINS UNKNOWN AS DOES MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT SPECIFIC NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES IN CF SUPPLEMENTS FOR CHILDREN WITH CF SHOULD INCLUDE EXTRA ENERGY AS FAT OR CARBOHYDRATE A FORM OF LINOLEIC ACID THAT CAN BE ABSORBED HYDROLYZED PROTEIN FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS WITH VITAMINS A AND E IN A WATER EMULSION VITAMIN B PROBABLY B VITAMINS AND VITAMIN C AND TRACE MINERALS ROUTINE MEASUREMENTS OF NUTRITIONAL STATUS PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN WITH GROWTH FAILURE SHOULD BE MADE AT REGULAR INTERVALS AND SHOULD INCLUDE A THREE DAY DIET RECORD AND A SIMULTANEOUS HOUR STOOL FAT DETERMINATION IF FAT MALABSORPTION IS NOT CONTROLLED BY PANCREATIC ENZYMES THE USE OF ANTACIDS OR CIMETIDINE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THE TRUE ROLE OF NUTRITION IN PATIENTS WITH CF WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL THE APPROPRIATE STUDIES ARE COMPLETED
1116;PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAVE FAT MALABSORPTION PROVIDING AN EXPERIMENTAL MODEL FOR EVALUATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A LOW FAT INTAKE MAY PREVENT ATHEROSCLEROSIS WE STUDIED THE FREQUENCY AND EXTENT OF AORTIC PRECURSOR LESIONS FATTY STREAKS EARLY FIBROMUSCULOELASTIC LESIONS LATE FIBROMUSCULOELASTIC LESIONS FOUND AT AUTOPSY IN THIS DISEASE AS WELL AS IN OTHER PATIENTS WITH DEBILITATING DISORDERS BUT WITH NO APPARENT IMPAIRMENT OF FAT ABSORPTION FATTY STREAKS WERE LESS COMMON IN THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS GROUP AS WERE THE LATE FIBROMUSCULOELASTIC LESIONS THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE FREQUENCY LENGTH OR THICKNESS OF THE EARLY FIBROMUSCULOELASTIC LESIONS THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT FAT MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROGRESSION BUT NOT INITIATION OF THE FIBROMUSCULOELASTIC PRECURSOR LESIONS AND SUPPORT THE CONCEPT THAT EARLY RESTRICTION OF DIETARY FAT MAY PREVENT DELAY OR OTHERWISE MODIFY ATHEROSCLEROSIS IN THE ADULT
1117;WE HAVE ALSO FOUND A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HOUR URINARY PABA RECOVERY IN HEALTHY CONTROLS AND CF PATIENTS WITH NO OVERLAP OF THE RANGES AND A GOOD CORRELATION WITH FECAL CHYMOTRYPSIN ACTIVITY WE CAN STRESS THE USEFULNESS OF THE TEST IN THIS AGE GROUP IN STUDYING A GROUP OF HEALTHY NEWBORN INFANTS HOWEVER THE RESULTS WERE QUITE DIFFERENT THE PABA RECOVERY WAS SMALLER AND SHOWED GREATER VARIATIONS AND OVERLAP WITH RESULTS IN CF PATIENTS OCCURRED IT IS CLEAR THAT THE TEST IS NOT APPLICABLE IN NEWBORN INFANTS WHEN PERFORMED IN THE DESCRIBED MANNER ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION IS THE PHYSIOLOGICALLY LIMITED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE IN THE NEWBORN INFANT WHICH COULD HAVE DELAYED THE PABA EXCRETION
1118;BRAIN ABSCESS HAS ONLY RECENTLY BEEN CONSIDERED A COMPLICATION OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS THREE PATIENTS ARE REPORTED HERE AND A FOURTH CITED FROM THE LITERATURE ALL OF OUR PATIENTS WERE YOUNG ADULTS WITH ADVANCED PULMONARY DISEASE THE BACTERIA INVOLVED WERE MOUTH ORGANISMS AND WERE FOUND IN THE SPUTUM CULTURE IN ONLY ONE OF THE PATIENTS RESISTANCE WAS PRESENT TO PREVIOUSLY GIVEN ANTIBIOTICS AS PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS SURVIVE INTO ADULTHOOD THE RISK OF DEVELOPING A BRAIN ABSCESS APPEARS TO INCREASE

1122;I AGREE THAT SWEAT TESTS ARE FREQUENTLY NOT PERFORMED RELIABLY BUT I WONDER WHY THE CLINICAL CHEMIST HAS BEEN SINGLED OUT AS BEING RESPONSIBLE WHEN MOST HOSPITAL LABORATORIES ARE STILL DIRECTED BY PATHOLOGISTS AND NOT BY PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL CHEMISTS IN ADDITION TO OUR LABORATORY I KNOW OF MANY OTHER HOSPITAL CLINICAL CHEMISTRY LABORATORIES IN WHICH THE TEST IS BEING PERFORMED PROPERLY FURTHERMORE THE PEDIATRIC COMMITTEE OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CLINICAL CHEMISTRY IS WORKING ON A REVIEW ARTICLE FOR THE JOURNAL CLINICAL CHEMISTRY REGARDING THE CORRECT WAY THE SWEAT TEST SHOULD BE RUN CLEARLY CLINICAL CHEMISTS DO NOT LACK INTEREST
1123;THE MAJOR ISSUE IS NOT THE LACK OF INTEREST OF CLINICAL CHEMISTS BUT THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OF THE TEST NEITHER THE PATHOLOGIST NOR THE CLINICAL CHEMIST IN ALL LIKELIHOOD ACTUALLY PERFORMS THE TEST RATHER IT IS THE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIST OR TECHNICIAN WHO CARRIES OUT THE ACTUAL PROCEDURE IT IS A MAJOR PART OF OUR ROLES AS EDUCATORS AND LABORATORY ADMINISTRATORS TO ENSURE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE ADEQUATELY TRAINED FOR THE TASK AND THAT THE TEST MEETS HIGH ENOUGH PERFORMANCE STANDARDS TO PROVIDE A CLINICALLY RELEVANT ANSWER

1152;THIS PAPER IS A REPORT ON THE FIRST PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMME THE AIM IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MECHANICAL AID WHICH WILL ENABLE PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS TO GIVE THEMSELVES SATISFACTORY PHYSIOTHERAPY THE PERCUSSOR WHICH CAN BE USED BY PATIENTS PARENTS OR RELATIVES IS PORTABLE AND LIGHTWEIGHT THE DOMICILIARY TRIAL SHOWED THAT EFFECTIVE PERCUSSION COULD BE SELF ADMINISTERED TO THE FRONT OF THE CHEST AND TO A LESSER EXTENT TO THE SIDES OF THE CHEST THE PERCUSSOR WAS FOUND TO BE VERY ACCEPTABLE TO ADOLESCENT PATIENTS AND ESPECIALLY GIRLS WITH EARLY BREAST DEVELOPMENT FURTHER RESEARCH WORK HAS NOW BEEN COMPLETED AND AS A RESULT A SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WHICH ENABLES PATIENTS TO TREAT THEMSELVES WITH SATISFACTORY CHEST PERCUSSION IN THE FIVE PREFERRED POSITIONS OF POSTURAL DRAINAGE
1153;IN WE DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICIENCY OF AUTOGENIC DRAINAGE WITH TWO BRONCHORRHEIC CHILDREN WHO NEEDED BRONCHOGRAPHY FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES THIS DEMONSTRATION WAS MADE POSSIBLE THANKS TO A RADIOCINEMATOGRAPHIC STUDY AFTER BRONCHOGRAPHY THE EXAMINATION ALSO SHOWED THE INEFFICACY OF COUGHING THE OBJECT OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO ANALYZE THE PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISM OF AUTOGENIC DRAINAGE FOR CHILDREN OLDER THAN FIVE THIS METHOD IS VERY SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT AND AS THE EFFORT OR ONSET IS NOT EXCESSIVE AND AS EXPIRATION DOES NOT NEED TO BE COMPLETE AUTOGENIC DRAINAGE IS NOT EXHAUSTING AND CAN BE PERFORMED FOR A LONG TIME WHICH IS INDISPENSABLE SINCE THE PROGRESSION OF SECRETIONS IS SLOW
1155;THE PROBLEM OF PROPER DIET TO CHILDREN AND INFANTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS CONTINUOUSLY DISCUSSED THIS PAPER DEALS WITH THE DIET FOR CF INFANTS YOUNGER THAN ONE YEAR THE BASIC VIEW IS THAT THE DIET SHOULD BE AS CLOSE TO THE NORMAL BABY DIET AS POSSIBLE PARTLY TO ENSURE NORMAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PARTLY TO AVOID EXTRA WORK FOR THE FAMILIES WITH CF INFANTS INFANTS SUFFERING FROM CF WERE GIVEN LACTOSE FREE DIET UNTIL THEY REACHED THE AGE OF ONE YEAR THE WEIGHT INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY THAN IN CF PATIENTS GIVEN THE TRADITIONAL CF DIET WITH LOW FAT AND HIGH PROTEIN FURTHERMORE IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO GIVE INCREASED AMOUNTS OF CALORIES TO THE INFANTS GIVEN LACTOSE FREE DIET NOR DID THEY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS
1156;THIS REVIEW EMPHASIZES SOME OF THE POSITIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS RESEARCH SOME OF THE PUZZLES AND SOME OF THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAVE PROMISE ONE OF THE MAJOR UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS IS THE MAINTENANCE OF THIS LETHAL GENE AT SUCH A HIGH FREQUENCY PERHAPS BECAUSE OF A HETEROZYGOTE ADVANTAGE IN THE PAST NO LONGER OPERATIVE AT PRESENT NOTHING IS KNOWN OF THE CHROMOSOMAL LOCALIZATION OF THE TRAIT EXCEPT THAT CHROMOSOMES ARE MORPHOLOGICALLY NORMAL THAT IT IS AUTOSOMAL NOT SEX LINKED AND THAT THERE IS NO CORRELATION WITH BLOOD GROUPS OR MAJOR HLA LOCI ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PAST MANY YEARS IS THAT WE UNDERSTAND RELATIVELY WELL THE PATHOGENESIS OF MOST CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF CF THE AS YET UNKNOWN INHERITED BASIC DEFECT OR METABOLIC ERROR OF CF GIVES RISE TO TWO MAIN ANOMALIES THE ELECTROLYTE DEFECT IN EXOCRINE SWEAT GLANDS AND THE MUCOUS SECRETION ABNORMALITY WHILE THE RESULTS OF TISSUE CULTURE STUDIES OFTEN HAVE BEEN CONFLICTING AND DISPARATE IT DOES SEEM TO BE THE CONSENSUS THAT THE FIBROBLASTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE BASIC METABOLIC ERROR IN SOME MANNER AND THAT THEY RESPOND ABNORMALLY UNDER DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES VIRTUALLY ALL INVESTIGATORS HAVE FOUND SOME ANOMALIES IN BIOLOGIC FLUIDS OF CF ALTHOUGH USING DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND METHODS AN ABNORMALITY IN THE FUNCTION OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH IS SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXOCRINE GLANDS HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ATTRACTIVE EXPLANATION FOR THE GENERALIZED EXOCRINOPATHY OF CF THE SEARCH FOR A GENETIC ANIMAL MODEL FOR CF HAS LED TO INTERESTING FINDINGS
1157;WATER ELECTROLYTE AND MACROMOLECULAR SECRETION WHICH IS AFFECTED IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS REGULATED BY NEUROTRANSMITTERS OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM STIMULATING THE CELLS BY BINDING TO ALPHA ADRENERGIC BETA ADRENERGIC AND CHOLINERGIC RECEPTORS THEREFORE A GENETIC DISTURBANCE IN CYCLIC ADENOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE C AMP RESPONSE COULD EVENTUALLY EXPLAIN SOME OF THE MANIFOLD EXPRESSIONS OF LABILE BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES OBSERVED IN CF SPECIALLY IN TISSUE CULTURE WE FURTHER CHARACTERIZED BETA RECEPTORS IN CULTURED FIBROBLASTS OF CF PATIENTS AND NORMAL CONTROLS AND INVESTIGATED ISOPROTERENOL AND PROSTAGLANDIN E MEDIATED C AMP RESPONSE USING DEFINED CULTURE CONDITIONS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO PHENOTYPES ON BASAL C AMP VALUES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE CELL LINE CF STRAINS HAD TO INCREASED C AMP CONTENT THIS DIFFERENCE IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT P THIS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN RESPONSE CAN NEITHER BE ATTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENCES IN DOSE OR TIME RESPONSE CURVES NOR TO DIFFERENTIAL C AMP ESCAPE INTO CULTURE MEDIUM SINCE CF CELLS SYNTHESIZE MORE C AMP THAN CONTROLS ONLY IN RESPONSE TO ISOPROTERENOL BUT NOT TO PROSTAGLANDIN E THE ALTERATION WHICH MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OBSERVED PHENOMENON IS PROBABLY LOCATED PROXIMAL OF THE ADENYLATE CYCLASE AT THE CELLS BORDER BETWEEN INTRA AND EXTRACELLULAR SPACE
1158;THIS PAPER PRESENTS PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM METABOLIC BALANCE STUDIES OF IRON ZINC AND MANGANESE ABSORPTION AND RETENTION IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND SHWACHMAN S SYNDROME MALABSORPTION OF ZINC IRON AND MANGANESE IN EXOCRINE PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY THESE EARLY STUDIES A POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS AND THE ASSOCIATED FEATURES OF CF HAS BEEN BRIEFLY DISCUSSED AND INDICATES AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IF SUCH RELATIONSHIPS ARE ESTABLISHED THEN SOME FORM OF TRACE ELEMENT SUPPLEMENTATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
1159;WE HAVE INVESTIGATED TWO ASPECTS OF PROSTAGLANDIN FUNCTION IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS THE RESPONSE OF PLATELETS TO PGE AND THE CONCENTRATIONS OF PGE AND PGE ALPHA IN THE SWEAT LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF PGE HAVE LESS EFFECT ON PLATELET AGGLUTINATION IN CF PATIENTS AND HETEROZYGOTES THAN IN NORMALS BUT NO DIFFERENCE IS OBSERVED WHEN HIGH PG CONCENTRATIONS ARE USED SWEAT PGE AND PGE ALPHA CONCENTRATIONS ARE SIMILAR IN NORMALS CF PATIENTS AND HETEROZYGOTES BUT SWEAT PGE CONCENTRATIONS ARE PROPORTIONAL TO NA CL LEVELS IN CF BUT NOT IN CONTROL CHILDREN OR HETEROZYGOTES
1160;RECENTLY ONE OF US SUGGESTED A NEW HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING THE BASIC DEFECT OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT PAPER IS TO REVIEW THIS MODEL AND TO CRITICALLY DISCUSS ITS EVENTUAL DIAGNOSTIC APPLICATIONS WITH EXTENSIVE STUDIES WE COLLECTED EXPERIMENTAL DATA WHICH CONTRIBUTE FIVE MAJOR ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF THE PROPOSITION THAT CF MAY BE AN ENZYME RECOGNITION SITE MUTANT WITH FIBROBLAST CULTURES THE THREE GENOTYPES CAN BE SEPARATED IN THE FOLLOWING WAY CF HOMOZYGOTE LEAKY FOR ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE A P AND LYSOSOMAL HYDROLASES A P IS TAMM HORSFALL GLYCOPROTEIN THP INDUCIBLE CF HETEROZYGOTE LEAKY FOR A P AND LYSOSOMAL HYDROLASES A P IS NOT THP INDUCIBLE NORMAL CONTROL NOT LEAKY FOR A P AND LYSOSOMAL ENZYMES A P IS NOT THP INDUCIBLE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SECOND DOUBLE BLIND STUDY THE THP INDUCTION AS WELL AS THE LEAKAGE ANALYSIS SEEM TO BE STATISTICALLY UNEQUIVOCAL THEY STRONGLY SUPPORT OUR HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING THE BASIC DEFECT IN CF
1161;STUDIES ARE PRESENTED ON THE SERUM LEVEL OF SEVERAL ACID GLYCOSIDASES IN NORMAL AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS SUBJECTS LEVELS OF ALPHA GLUCOSIDASE FOUND IN SERUM FROM CF PATIENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN FROM NORMALS AND HETEROZYGOTES THE INCREASE IN ALPHA GLUCOSIDASE WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE CLINICAL GRAVITY OF THE DISEASE LEVELS OF ALL OTHER GLYCOSIDASES STUDIED IN CF PATIENTS WERE IN THE NORMAL RANGE
1162;IN RECENT YEARS SEVERAL WORKERS HAVE REPORTED THAT A SINGLE HOUR POSTPRANDIAL TOTAL SERUM BILE ACID TSBA CONCENTRATION IN A VARIETY OF LIVER DISEASE STATES IS A MORE SENSITIVE INDEX OF DERANGED LIVER FUNCTION THAN ARE THE CONVENTIONAL SERUM LIVER FUNCTION TESTS THIS OBSERVATION SEEMED TO US TO PROVIDE A CHALLENGING SITUATION FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TSBA CONCENTRATIONS IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS THE DISTRIBUTION OF RESULTS FOR THE CF PATIENTS MEAN TSBA CONCENTRATION MICROMOL L AND FOR THE AGE MATCHED CONTROLS MEAN CONCENTRATION MICROMOL L SHOWS A WIDER RANGE FOR THE CF GROUP STATISTICAL ANALYSIS HOWEVER OF THESE TWO GROUPS SHOWS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM MANY FACTORS AFFECT BOTH THE SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE BILE ACID POOL IN CF AND A CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTORS MAY GO SOME WAY TOWARDS EXPLAINING THE RATHER UNSPECTACULAR TSBA RESULTS
1163;WE DECIDED TO SURVEY A GEOGRAPHICALLY DEFINED POPULATION OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS AND PARENTS LIVING IN AVON COUNTY ENGLAND BY EXAMINING THE OBLIGATE HETEROZYGOTES THE PARENTS WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF THE CF GENE WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF THE DISEASE THERE IS AN INCREASE IN IMMEDIATE HYPERSENSITIVITY TO A FUMIGATUS IN CF PATIENTS BUT NOT THEIR PARENTS THIS INCREASED SENSITIVITY IS PROBABLY IGE MEDIATED AND A SECONDARY EFFECT OF LUNG DAMAGE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE CF GENE PRODUCES A GENERALISED INCREASE IN SKIN REACTIVITY ATOPY SERUM IGE OR SERUM IGG IN THE HETEROZYGOTES THEY ARE NOT THEREFORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP ASTHMA
1164;IN OUR EFFORTS TO STANDARDIZE THE EVALUATION OF BRONCHIAL REACTIVITY WE PERFORMED INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE THRESHOLD DOSAGE OF ACETYLCHOLINE INDUCED BRONCHOSPASM IN PATIENTS WITH VARIOUS RECURRENT AND CHRONIC BRONCHOPULMONARY DISEASES A SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED THRESHOLD VALUE OF ACETYLCHOLINE AND THUS AN INCREASED BRONCHIAL REACTIVITY COULD BE PROVEN IN PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN COMPARISON WITH HEALTHY CHILDREN THE CAUSE OF BRONCHIAL HYPERREACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH CF MAY BE DUE TO PROTEASES DERIVING FROM LEUCOCYTES OF THE PURULENT SPUTUM FURTHERMORE WE INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF TERBUTALINE ON THE BRONCHIAL OBSTRUCTION INDUCED BY ACETYLCHOLINE IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS THE GROUPS WERE COMPARABLE ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO THE DEGREE OF THE INITIAL BRONCHIAL OBSTRUCTION
1165;THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO REASSESS THE PERIPHERAL PATTERN OF THYROID FUNCTION IN SUBJECTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THEIR RESPONSIVENESS TO THYROTROPIN RELEASING HORMONE TRH STIMULATION IN ALL THE CF PATIENTS THE BASAL LEVELS OF SERUM T T AND TBG WERE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE MEAN VALUES IN CF PATIENTS AND IN CONTROL CHILDREN WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN CF PATIENTS THERE IS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TSH RESPONSE AREA AND THE BASAL LEVEL OF SERUM T OR WITH GRADING ACCORDING TO SHWACHMAN AND KULCZYCKI WE FOUND NO RELATION WITH THERAPY IN BASAL CONDITIONS OUR DATA SHOW A COMPLETELY NORMAL PATTERN OF THE SERUM CONCENTRATION OF T T TBG AND TSH IN SUBJECTS WITH CF IN ABSENCE OF IODIDE THERAPY THYROID STATUS SHOULD BE EXAMINED IN PATIENTS WITH CF SPECIALLY WHEN THEY RECEIVE IODIDE THERAPY OR OTHER DRUGS WHICH CAN ENHANCE THE IMPAIRMENT OF THYROID FUNCTION

1167;AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR ASSAYING THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS FACTOR COULD BE ON THE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF ISOLATED LIVING TISSUES THE ABILITY OF THE FROG S GASTRIC MUCOSA TO SECRETE HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND MAINTAIN A NEGATIVE POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE IS WELL KNOWN THIS POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE ACROSS THE SECRETORY MUCOSA TO THE NUTRIENT SEROSA SIDE COUPLED WITH ITS PROPERTY OF TRANSPORTING CHLORIDE AND HYDROGEN IONS AGAINST AN ELECTROCHEMICAL GRADIENT COULD THEREFORE SERVE AS A USEFUL MODEL FOR INVESTIGATING ANY INDUCED CHANGES IN THE PRESENCE OF CF AND NON CF PLASMA FROM THE RESULTS OBTAINED THE SHORT CIRCUIT CURRENT AND H SECRETION RESPONSES IN THE PRESENCE OF CF WHOLE PLASMA SHOW SIGNIFICANT INCREASES COMPARED TO THE CONTROL THESE FINDINGS SHOW THAT IN THE PRESENCE OF CF PLASMA WHOLE OR PLASMA FRACTION B THERE IS A MARKED INCREASE IN THE ACTIVELY TRANSPORTED CL AND H THE EFFECT OF CF PLASMA IN INCREASING NET CL FLUX IS IMPORTANT CONSIDERING THE ELEVATION OF THIS ELECTROLYTE IN THE SWEAT OF CF PATIENTS AND DESERVED FURTHER INVESTIGATION
1168;ELLIOTT S WORKS TOGETHER WITH THE PREVIOUS WORKS OF SEVERAL AUTHORS REPORTING LOW ESSENTIAL FATTY ACID CONCENTRATIONS IN THE SERUM LIPIDS OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS STIMULATED US TO MAKE A PILOT STUDY TREATING OLDER CF PATIENTS WITH INTRALIPID FOR YEAR WE FOUND NO SIDE EFFECTS IN TREATING OLDER CF PATIENTS WITH INTRALIPID FOR YEAR ON THE OTHER HAND THE OBJECTIVE BENEFIT WAS VERY LIMITED AND TODAY CONFUSING I E ONLY A SLIGHT BUT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE RENAL SODIUM EXCRETION AFTER AN ORAL SODIUM LOAD WAS FOUND THE RELEVANCE OF THIS IS SPECULATIVE
1169;PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAVE A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF POSITIVE SKIN PRICK TESTS THAN NORMAL THIS MAY BE THE RESULT OF DEFECTIVE ANTIGEN HANDLING AT MUCOSAL SURFACES OUR AIM WAS TO INVESTIGATE BRONCHIAL ALLERGY IN A GROUP OF CHILDREN WITH CF AND POSITIVE SKIN TESTS WE STUDIED CHILDREN AGED TO YEARS WITH MILD TO MODERATE RESPIRATORY DISEASE ONLY CHILD GAVE A HISTORY OF WHEEZING NOT ASSOCIATED WITH CHEST INFECTIONS AND THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CLINICAL ASTHMA IS A PRODUCT OF BRONCHIAL ALLERGY AND BRONCHOLABILITY THE RESPONSES TO BRONCHIAL PROVOCATION WITH ASPERGILLUS SUGGEST THAT ALLERGY TO THIS ANTIGEN MAY PLAY A PART IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF LUNG DISEASE IN SOME PATIENTS WITH CF
1170;WE FOCUSED OUR STUDY ON CONCENTRATION OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS LYSOZYME LACTOFERRIN SOME ANTIPROTEOLYTIC FRACTIONS AND ACUTE PHASE PROTEINS IN BRONCHIAL SECRETION OF CHILDREN WITH VARIOUS PULMONARY DISEASES ESPECIALLY WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS SECRETORY IGA IS DECREASED IN ALL STUDIED GROUPS OF PATIENTS HAVING CHRONIC OR RECURRENT INFECTIONS OF THE RESPIRATORY TRACT WHEN COMPARED TO THE GROUP OF HEALTHY CHILDREN GROUPS WHICH WERE CHARACTERIZED BY THE INFECTION OF THE LOWER PART OF THE RESPIRATORY TRACT HAD INCREASED LYSOZYME LEVEL THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE GROUP OF CF CHILDREN ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OBTAINED IN GROUPS WITH BRONCHIECTASIS AND CHRONIC BRONCHITIS WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE OBSERVED DIFFERENCES ARE CHARACTERISTIC FOR CHRONIC INFECTION RATHER THAN FOR CF ALTHOUGH IN CF AS WELL AS IN BRONCHIECTASIS MASSIVE BACTERIAL INFECTION RESULTS IN INCREASED CONCENTRATION OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS ANTIPROTEOLYTIC FRACTIONS AND ACUTE PHASE PROTEINS THE RESULTS SEEN IN BOTH GROUPS ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THESE DIFFERENCES MAY INDICATE SOME DIFFERENCE IN THE REACTIVITY TO INFECTION OF THE RESPIRATORY TRACT IN CF IN COMPARISON TO PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIECTASIS IT SEEMS CONCEIVABLE THAT AMONG CHILDREN WITH CF WHO HAVE VERY LOW S IGA CHRONIC RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS OCCUR EARLIER AND IGG RESPONSE TO PERMANENT EXPOSITION TO VARIETY OF ANTIGENS IS LESS VIGOROUS THE PRESENTED RESULTS RAISE ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT THE BACTERIAL INFECTION IN CF DOES NOT STIMULATE DEFENCE MECHANISMS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS IN BRONCHIECTASIS
1171;THIS STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER BIOLOGIC ACTIVATION OF C WITH SUBSEQUENT PULMONARY INFLAMMATION TAKES PLACE IN THE LUNGS OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS PLASMA COMPLEMENT C LEVELS WERE ALL NORMAL ELEVEN OF THE PATIENTS WITH THE C SPLIT PRODUCT C C WERE FROM THE GROUP OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC INFECTION WITH MUCOID STRAINS OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA AND WERE FROM THE GROUP OF CF PATIENTS WITHOUT P AERUGINOSA INFECTION THIS DIFFERENCE WAS SIGNIFICANT P A COMPARISON OF ALBUMIN RATIOS BETWEEN THE PATIENTS WITH THE C SPLIT PRODUCT C C AND THE REMAINING OTHER PATIENTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT HIGHER RATIO IN THE FORMER GROUP P ON AN AVERAGE VERSUS PER CENT THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ALBUMIN RATIO DEMONSTRATED IN THE PATIENTS WITH C C IN THEIR SPUTUM SOL PHASE SUPPORTS THE CONCEPT OF COMPLEMENT INDUCED INFLAMMATION WITH SUBSEQUENT TRANSUDATION OF PLASMA PROTEINS IN THESE PATIENTS THIS STUDY THUS SHOWS THAT COMPLEMENT MEDIATED INFLAMMATORY REACTIONS MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF PULMONARY TISSUE DAMAGE IN PATIENTS WITH CF EVEN WHEN THE PLASMA C LEVELS ARE NORMAL AND IT SUPPORTS THE CONCEPT OF CHRONIC P AERUGINOSA LUNG INFECTION AS AN IMMUNE COMPLEX DISEASE IN CF PATIENTS
1172;TO STUDY THE PAROTID GLAND FUNCTION IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS WE INVESTIGATED PAROTID SALIVA SPECIMENS OF SUCH PATIENTS WE COMPARED THE RESULTS WITH A CONTROL GROUP OF HEALTHY CHILDREN OF THE SAME AGE AND SEX FURTHERMORE CHILDREN WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA AND CHRONIC BRONCHITIS WERE EXAMINED THE FLOW RATE OF THE PAROTID AND THE PROTEIN OUTPUT WITHOUT STIMULATION WERE NEARLY THE SAME FOR THE FOUR GROUPS IN PATIENTS WITH CF THE PROTEIN OUTPUT AFTER STIMULATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AN INCREASED LEVEL OF SODIUM WAS OBSERVED IN THE STIMULATED SECRETION AND THE UNSTIMULATED SALIVA AS WELL IN CF CHILDREN WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT HIGHER OUTPUT OF SODIUM IN BOTH STIMULATED PAROTID SALIVA AND UNSTIMULATED PAROTID SALIVA THE IGG OUTPUT OF THE GLAND AFTER STIMULATION WAS FOUND TO BE SLIGHTLY REDUCED IN PATIENTS WITH CF IN COMPARISON TO HEALTHY CHILDREN THE OUTPUT OF THE GLAND FOR IGA AFTER STIMULATION WAS OBSERVED TO BE STRONGLY REDUCED FOR THE GROUP WITH CF AND FOR THE GROUP WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA THE DECREASED OUTPUT OF THE GLAND FOR SECRETORY IGA AFTER STIMULATION WAS DEMONSTRATED AGAIN IN CF AND IN BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IN COMPARISON WITH HEALTHY PERSONS THE INCREASED SODIUM CONCENTRATION IN PAROTID SALIVA MAY BE CAUSED IN A SIMILAR WAY AS THE ELECTROLYTE ABNORMALITY OF SWEAT IN CF PATIENTS NAMELY BY A DECREASED NET REABSORPTION OF SODIUM DUE TO THE RESULT OF AN INCREASED ELECTROLYTE OUTPUT AND DECREASED IMMUNOGLOBULIN OUTPUT OF PAROTID GLAND WE CAN SUPPOSE THAT THE MOLECULAR MAGNITUDE PLAYS ITS ROLE IN THIS DISTURBANCE
1173;WALLWORK AND CO WORKERS HAVE PROPOSED THAT INCREASED ABSORPTION OF ANTIGENS TAKES PLACE ACROSS THE MUCOSAL MEMBRANES OF THE GUT AND RESPIRATORY TRACT POSSIBLY DUE TO A TRANSIENT DEFECT IN THE PRODUCTION OF SECRETORY IGA AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS HYPOTHESIS ONE WOULD EXPECT CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS TO PRODUCE A PRONOUNCED ANTIBODY RESPONSE AGAINST THE INTESTINAL BACTERIAL FLORA THE PRESENT WORK WAS THEREFORE CARRIED OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE ANTIBODY RESPONSE IN CF PATIENTS AND IN NORMAL PERSONS AGAINST ESCHERICHIA COLI AND BACTEROIDES FRAGILIS WHICH ARE PRESENT IN THE GUT IN LARGE NUMBERS AND AGAINST THE RESPIRATORY PATHOGEN P AERUGINOSA A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PREVALENCE OF PRECIPITINS AGAINST EACH OF THE BACTERIAL SPECIES WAS FOUND IN CF PATIENTS COMPARED TO NORMAL PERSONS AND THE PREVALENCE OF PRECIPITINS AGAINST EACH OF THESE BACTERIA INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH AGE AS REGARDS P AERUGINOSA PRECIPITINS THE PREVALENCE AND NUMBER WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN CF PATIENTS WHO HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY SUCCUMBED COMPARED TO CF PATIENTS WHO ARE STILL ALIVE SUCH A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE ANTIBODY RESPONSE AND THE PROGNOSIS OF THE PATIENTS WAS NOT FOUND AS REGARDS E COLI OR B FRAGILIS CONSIDERING THE HYPOTHESIS OF WALLWORK AND CO WORKERS CONCERNING INCREASED ABSORPTION OF ANTIGENS FROM THE GUT IT SEEMS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO SUPPOSE THAT INCREASED ABSORPTION OF ANTIGENS FROM THE GUT FLORA OCCURS PREDOMINANTLY IN CF PATIENTS WITH P AERUGINOSA LUNG INFECTION WITH A PRONOUNCED ANTIBODY RESPONSE AGAINST P AERUGINOSA
1174;IN AN YEAR PERIOD A PROGRAMME OF SCREENING FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED OVER AN EXTENSIVE PART OF WALES THE SCREENING METHOD USED IS BASED ON THE DETECTION OF A HIGH LEVEL OF ALBUMEN GREATER THAN MG IN THE MECONIUM DURING THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS SEVERAL DIFFERENT TESTS HAVE BEEN USED BECAUSE OF THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF FALSE NEGATIVE RESULTS THE DETECTION OF PROTEIN IN MECONIUM IS NOT AN IDEAL SCREENING TEST BUT IS THE MOST SATISFACTORY PRESENTLY AVAILABLE IN THE NEWBORN PERIOD BECAUSE OF ITS RELATIVE SIMPLICITY LOW COST ABSENCE OF DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF THE PARENT OR PATIENT AND A HIGH YIELD OF POSITIVE CASES ITS USE ON A WIDER SCALE MAY BE JUSTIFIED
1175;SEVERAL REPORTS HAVE INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF ABNORMALLY HIGH AMOUNTS OF SULPHATE IN THE MUCOUS GLANDS OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS BEARING THESE FACTS IN MIND WE SUSPECTED THAT ABNORMAL OVER SULPHATED AND STRONGLY ANIONIC GLYCOPROTEINS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF CF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE WHETHER SULPHATED BLOOD GROUP SUBSTANCES OCCUR IN NORMAL PANCREATIC TISSUE THE DISTRIBUTION OF SULPHATE OVER THE EXOCRINE PART OF PANCREAS DOES COINCIDE WITH THE DISTRIBUTION OF BLOOD GROUP SUBSTANCE PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED BY FLUORESCENT MICROSCOPY WE THEREFORE FIND IT VERY LIKELY THAT THE SULPHATE AND BLOOD GROUP SUBSTANCE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME GLYCOPROTEIN MOLECULE SINCE BLOOD GROUP SUBSTANCE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN MANY SECRETIONS IN MAN AND SINCE HIGH AMOUNTS OF SULPHATE HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE MUCOUS GLANDS IN CF SUCH A MECHANISM IS POSSIBLE IN MANY LOCATIONS AND MAY THUS OFFER AN EXPLANATION FOR THE MULTIORGAN INVOLVEMENT IN CF
1176;RECENTLY ANTONOWICZ ET AL PROPOSED A SIMPLE TEST FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS THAT COULD BE USED TO VERIFY THE BOEHRINGER MANNHEIM MECONIUM TEST RESULT AND THUS REDUCE THE FALSE POSITIVE INCIDENCE THE TEST IS BASED ON THE DETECTION OF LACTASE ACTIVITY IN MECONIUM THE LACTASE TEST MAY BE OF SOME VALUE AS A CONFIRMATORY TEST WHEN USED WITH THE BM MEC TEST ALTHOUGH ITS SPECIFICITY IN THIS STUDY WAS NOT AS GOOD AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED
1177;USUALLY CARDIAC AFFECTION IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS SECONDARY TO PROGRESSIVE AFFECTION OF THE LUNGS COR PULMONALE IN RARE CASES BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN SHOW A PRIMARY AND SEVERE CARDIAC AFFECTION CAUSED BY MYOCARDIAL FIBROSIS WE COULD RECENTLY OBSERVE TWO OF THESE CASES IN OUR CLINIC THE CASES ARE PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED IN BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN CARDIAC INSUFFICIENCY CAUSED BY CARDIOMYOPATHY MIGHT BE THE FIRST PRESENTING SYMPTOM IN CF THEREFORE IN ALL CHILDREN WITH CARDIOMYOPATHY OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN CF HAS TO BE SUSPECTED AND THE SWEAT TEST HAS TO BE PERFORMED RAPIDLY PROGRESSIVE CARDIAC INSUFFICIENCY RESPONDING POORLY TO TREATMENT AND RHYTHM DISTURBANCES ARE TYPICAL CORRECT EARLY DIAGNOSIS IS IMPORTANT FOR EARLY GENETIC COUNSELING
1178;MECONIUM SPECIMENS FROM MORE THAN NORMAL AND PREMATURE AND FROM CYSTIC FIBROSIS NEWBORNS WERE ANALYZED FOR THEIR LEVEL OF SEVERAL GLYCOSIDASES CONSIDERABLE SCATTER OF ACTIVITIES WERE FOUND IN ALL THREE GROUPS STUDIED AND NO EVIDENCE FOR ANY RELATION OF SUCH SCATTER WITH THE BLOOD GROUP SPECIFIC A B AB H SUBSTANCES WAS FOUND ALPHA GLUCOSIDASE AN ACID GLYCOSIDASE FOUND ELEVATED IN CF SERUM AND FIBROBLASTS WAS ELEVATED IN ALL CF MECONIUM EXTRACTS INCLUDING THAT WHICH HAD A VERY LOW ALBUMIN CONTENT
1179;INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY OPINION IS EXPRESSED THAT ANTIBIOTICS ARE AMONG THE MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED DRUGS IN UNITED STATES PROBABLY ALSO IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES WHILE IT IS ADOPTED BY MANY THAT THE INCREASED LONGEVITY OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS IS STRONGLY RELATED TO ANTIBIOTIC USAGE THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DOCUMENTED ADEQUATELY THE PRINCIPLES WHICH WE TRY TO FOLLOW WHILE USING ANTIBIOTICS IN CF PATIENTS ARE OUTLINED
1180;THE AIM OF OUR CLINICAL STUDY WAS TO FIND IF PROLONGED TOBRAMYCIN THERAPY CAN PREVENT FURTHER RAPID DETERIORATION IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS ELEVEN COURSES OF TREATMENT WERE GIVEN TO THE NINE PATIENTS EIGHT OF THESE MARKEDLY IMPROVED THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND GAINED WEIGHT HOWEVER ONLY IN FOUR OF THESE PATIENTS WAS CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT CORRELATED WITH AN IMPROVED RADIOGRAM PSEUDOMONAS WAS ERADICATED FROM THE SPUTUM OF ONLY FOUR PATIENTS DURING THERAPY BUT REAPPEARED IN THREE OF THEM BEFORE THE END OF THERAPY CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT AND NEGLIGIBLE SIDE EFFECTS SUGGEST TREATMENT OF EXACERBATING PYOCYANEUS BRONCHOPNEUMONIA WITH PROLONGED TOBRAMYCIN THERAPY DOSAGE SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN MG KG DAY WITH STRICT CONTROL OF TOBRAMYCIN BLOOD LEVEL AND AWARENESS OF SIDE EFFECTS
1181;THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE ABSORPTION AND DISPOSITION IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS OF TWO COMMONLY USED ANTIBIOTICS AN AMINOPENICILLIN EPICILLIN AND A CEPHALEXIN OSPEXIN THE PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS OF EPICILLIN IN PATIENTS WITH CF AND THEIR NORMAL CONTROLS DIFFER IN A NUMBER OF ASPECTS THE DIFFERENCE FOUND IN THE MAXIMAL PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS COULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY A MANIFOLD INCREASE IN THE RENAL CLEARANCE OF THE DRUG OUR DATA SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT PATIENTS WITH CF EXHIBIT AN UNUSUALLY LARGE AND RAPID RENAL CLEARANCE OF CERTAIN PENICILLINS
1182;SINCE THE DRESDEN MEETING IN THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN A FEW NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF INTEREST IN SPECIAL FIELD OF SCREENING FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS THERE IS NO IDEAL SCREENING TEST FOR CF AVAILABLE TODAY THE BM TEST MECONIUM IS THE TEST MOST WIDELY USED NOW BUT MANY TECHNICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS REMAIN TO BE SOLVED BEFORE THE TEST CAN BE ENDORSED WITHOUT RESERVATION
1183;GORDEUK ET AL STATE THAT CYSTIC FIBROSIS MAY BE FIRST DIAGNOSED IN ADULTHOOD BUT WE FEEL THAT A CONDITION WITH SUCH GRAVE GENETIC AND PROGNOSTIC IMPLICATIONS MUST BE DIAGNOSED WITH SPECIAL CAUTION IN THIS AGE GROUP IN PARTICULAR THE SWEAT TEST WHICH IS THE MAIN DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR USE WITH CHILDREN MUST BE INTERPRETED IN ADULTS IN THE LIGHT OF POSSIBLE AGE RELATED INCREASES IN NORMAL SWEAT ELECTROLYTE CONCENTRATION AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE ASSAY ALTHOUGH IT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT NORMAL SWEAT SODIUM AND CHLORIDE CONCENTRATIONS ARE HIGHER IN ADULTS THAN IN CHILDREN THERE IS NO CLEAR AGREEMENT ABOUT THE UPPER LIMITS OF THE NORMAL RANGE IN ADULTS THE VOLUME OF SWEAT PRODUCED DURING THE TEST MAY ALSO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON ELECTROLYTE VALUES FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN ADULTS AN ATTEMPT SHOULD THUS BE MADE TO BASE THE DIAGNOSIS NOT ONLY ON ELEVATED SWEAT ELECTROLYTE VALUES AND CLINICAL IMPRESSION BUT ALSO ON PANCREATIC FUNCTION DATA
1184;THE CASE OF A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF COMA IS PRESENTED SHE WAS FOUND SHORTLY AFTER BIRTH TO HAVE MECONIUM ILEUS AND A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF SODIUM IN HER SWEAT INDICATIVE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS CLINICAL DIAGNOSES WERE CYSTIC FIBROSIS OF PANCREAS CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER AND CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE SECONDARY TO ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE ANATOMICAL DIAGNOSES WERE CYSTIC FIBROSIS OF PANCREAS WITH CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER AND ESOPHAGEAL VARICES BRAIN NECROSIS METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY BRONCHIECTASIS ACUTE BRONCHOPNEUMONIA AND ACUTE RENAL TUBULAR NECROSIS

1222;WE HAVE SHOWN THAT SKIN FIBROBLAST FROM PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF AND FROM CARRIERS FOR CF HETEROZYGOTES HZ CONSUME MORE O THAN DO THEIR CONTROLS WHEN THE MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON TRANSPORT INHIBITOR ROTENONE WAS ADDED TO THE CELLS THE RELATIVE INHIBITION OF O CONSUMPTION WAS CF GREATER THAN HZ GREATER THAN CONTROLS P LESS THAN IN BOTH COMPARISONS BECAUSE ROTENONE SPECIFICALLY INHIBITS NADH DEHYDROGENASE NADH ACCEPTOR OXIDOREDUCTASE EC WHICH IS THE ENZYME OF ENERGY CONSERVING SITE OF THE MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON TRANSPORT SYSTEM ACTIVITY AND KINETICS OF THIS ENZYME SYSTEM WERE STUDIED IN FIBROBLAST HOMOGENATES NADH DEHYDROGENASE ACTIVITY WAS EQUAL IN CELLS FROM THE THREE GENOTYPES AT PH AFFINITY OF THE ENZYME FOR ITS SUBSTRATE WAS CF GREATER THAN HZ CONTROLS AT PH AFFINITY WAS CF GREATER THAN HZ CONTROLS P LESS THAN FOR THE DIFFERENCES PH OPTIMA FOR THE GENOTYPES WERE WITHOUT EXCEPTION CF HZ AND CONTROL HZ AND CONTROL LINES WERE DISTINGUISHED UNEQUIVOCALLY IN A BLIND TEST ON THE BASIS OF DIFFERENCES IN PH OPTIMA PURIFIED MITOCHONDRIAL PREPARATIONS REVEALED PH OPTIMA IDENTICAL TO THOSE FOUND IN WHOLE CELL HOMOGENATES THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT THE MUTANT GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR CF IS EXPRESSED IN THE COMPLEX MITOCHONDRIAL NADH DEHYDROGENASE SYSTEM
1223;TEN YEARS AGO WE DEMONSTRATED THAT CHRONIC ADMINISTRATION OF ISOPROTERENOL TO RATS RESULTS IS STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES OF THEIR SALIVARY GLANDS SIMILAR TO THOSE SEEN IN EXOCRINE GLANDS OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS RECENTLY WE BEGAN TO STUDY THE CELLULAR PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF THESE GLANDS AND MANAGED TO ACHIEVE PHARMACOLOGICAL CONTROL OF THIS ABNORMALITY WE DEMONSTRATED THAT ADMINISTRATION OF A BETA ADRENERGIC ANTAGONIST IN THESE ANIMALS RESULTED IN THE CORRECTION OF THE ELECTROLYTE ABNORMALITY WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT SEEN IN THE SWEAT GLANDS OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS THESE TWO EXAMPLES OF MANIPULATION OF THE SECRETORY PROCESSES IN EXOCRINE GLANDS OF EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH IN THE THERAPY OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS
1224;THE CHANGE OF LIFE EXPECTANCY OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS HAS STIMULATED OUR INTEREST IN ASSESSING THE UNDERSTANDING AND UTILIZATION OF GENETIC INFORMATION BY ADULT CF PATIENTS AND HOW THIS MAY AFFECT THEIR COPING MECHANISM S THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO OBTAIN INFORMATION IN THESE AREAS WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT MORE EFFECTIVE GENETIC COUNSELING MIGHT BE DEVELOPED FOR THIS ENLARGING GROUP OF PATIENTS KNOWLEDGE OF GENETICS ATTITUDES CONCERNING REPRODUCTION ATTITUDES TOWARD PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS AND ATTITUDES TOWARD A CARRIER IDENTIFICATION STUDY ARE REPORTED FOR MALES AND FEMALES WITH PROVEN CYSTIC FIBROSIS
1226;IN A SERIES OF CASES OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PRESENTING AT THE TRANSVAAL MEMORIAL HOSPITAL FOR CHILDREN JOHANNESBURG DURING THE YEAR PERIOD PATIENTS REQUIRED SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR COMPLICATIONS OF THE DISEASE MECONIUM ILEUS RECTAL PROLAPSE INTUSSUSCEPTION AND ETHMOIDITIS WERE THE COMMONEST SURGICAL PRESENTATIONS AND PORTAL HYPERTENSION BRONCHIAL OBSTRUCTION AND NASAL POLYPOSIS WERE ALSO EXPERIENCED AS THE BASIC DEFECT IS UNKNOWN TREATMENT TODAY IS STILL DIRECTED TOWARDS THESE USUALLY UNPREDICTABLE SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES
1227;THE BACTERIOLOGICAL EFFECT OF CHEMOTHERAPY AGAINST PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA PS AE IN LUNGS OF PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS REVIEWED DURING A YEAR PERIOD CHILDREN AND ADULTS WERE TREATED WITH COURSES OF DIFFERENT ANTIBIOTICS THE MUCOID STRAINS OF PS AE DISAPPEARED IN OF THE COURSES IN WHICH A COMBINATION OF TOBRAMYCIN AND CARBENICILLIN WAS EMPLOYED TOBRAMYCIN GIVEN ALONE HAD ONLY BACTERIOLOGICAL EFFECT IN OF THE COURSES COLIMYCIN ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH CARBENICILLIN HAD NO EFFECT IN PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED SUBSEQUENT COURSES OF TOBRAMYCIN AND COMBINATION OF TOBRAMYCIN AND CARBENICILLIN A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN FAVOUR OF THE COMBINATION THERAPY WAS FOUND ALSO IN CASES WITH MANY PRECIPITINS AGAINST PS AE IN SERUM IN OF THE INITIALLY SUCCESSFUL COURSES THE PATIENTS WERE RECOLONIZED WITH PS AE WITHIN MONTH NO NEPHROTOXIC OR OTOTOXIC SIDE EFFECTS WERE DEMONSTRATED IN SPITE OF THE HIGH DOSES OF TOBRAMYCIN MG KG H EMMPLOYED AND THE REPEATED COURSES
1228;BRONCHIAL SECRETIONS FROM CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM VARIOUS PULMONARY DISEASES AND FROM HEALTHY CONTROLS WERE TESTED CONCENTRATION OF IGA IGG LACTOFERRIN AND LYSOZYME THE RESULTS OBTAINED SUGGEST THAT IN MANY CASES OF CHRONIC LUNG DISEASES IN CHILDREN THE LEVELS OF LACTOFERRIN AND IMMUNOGLOBULINS ESPECIALLY SECRETORY IGA ARE VERY LOW IN SEVERE INFECTIONS CYSTIC FIBROSIS BRONCHIECTASES SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF IGG CONCENTRATION WAS OBSERVED
1229;THE CONCENTRATION OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS LACTOFERRIN AND LYSOZYME WE COMPARED IN BRONCHIAL SECRETIONS OBTAINED FROM CHILDREN WITH VARIOUS CHRONIC LUNG DISEASES THE IGG LACTOFERRIN AND LYSOZYME BUT NOT SECRETORY IGA CONCENTRATIONS WERE SHOWN TO BE INCREASED DURING CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE
1230;ASSAYS BASED ON THE COUNTING OF TOTAL CELLS AND OF COLONY FORMING CELLS WERE USED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT NEITHER DEXAMETHASONE NOR DIBUTYRYL ADENOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE CYCLIC AMP KILLS HUMAN FIBROBLASTS UNDER A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS THESE RESULTS CONTRADICT THOSE OF PREVIOUS STUDIES SHOWING THAT DEXAMETHASONE AND DIBUTYRYL CYCLIC AMP KILL A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF FIBROBLASTS FROM NORMAL HUMANS THAN FROM INDIVIDUALS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS
1231;CULTURED SKIN FIBROBLASTS FROM SUBJECTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS EXHIBITED NORMAL POPULATION DOUBLING TIMES IN EARLY PASSAGES AFTER ABOUT CUMULATIVE POPULATION DOUBLINGS CYSTIC FIBROSIS LINES DOUBLED MORE SLOWLY THAN CONTROLS AND CEASED DOUBLING AFTER ABOUT WEEKLY PASSAGES CONTROL LINES CONTINUED DOUBLING FOR PASSAGES THE PREMATURE SENESCENCE NOTED IN CELLS FROM SUBJECTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS RECONCILES CONTROVERSIAL OBSERVATIONS OF CELL DOUBLING REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE DATA PRESENTED HERE DEMONSTRATE THAT EXPERIMENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CELLS IN LATE PASSAGE MAY GENERATE MISLEADING RESULTS SINCE DIFFERENCES FROM CONTROL LINES MAY BE ASCRIBED TO GENERALIZED SENILE CHANGES RATHER THAN TO SPECIFIC RESULTS OF THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS GENOTYPE
1232;WITH THE EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND THE BETTER MANAGEMENT OF THESE PATIENTS IN CHILDHOOD INCREASING NUMBERS ARE SURVIVING TO ADULT LIFE THE MAIN PROBLEM REQUIRING CONTINUOUS MEDICAL CARE IN THE OLDER CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENT IS PERSISTING AND OFTEN PROGRESSIVE CHEST DISEASE FOR THIS REASON THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS CLINIC FOR ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS WAS STARTED IN THE WESTERN INFIRMARY IN THIS PAPER PRESENTS OUR OBSERVATIONS ON PATIENTS WHO HAD ATTENDED BETWEEN AND ELEVEN PATIENTS ARE ALIVE AND WELL AND HAVE SHOWN NO EVIDENCE OF DETERIORATION OVER THIS PERIOD TEN ARE AT SCHOOL OR IN REGULAR EMPLOYMENT WITH OPTIMUM MEDICAL SUPERVISION IT IS POSSIBLE TO GIVE YOUNG ADULTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS A WORTHWHILE EXISTENCE
1233;PSYCHOSOCIAL LITERATURE ON CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF IS CRITICALLY REVIEWED MAJOR METHODOLOGICAL SHORTCOMINGS INCLUDE THE ANECDOTAL NATURE OF FINDINGS OVEREMPHASIS ON NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DISEASE AND THE LACK OF A SUITABLE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AVENUES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ARE SUGGESTED
1234;THIS REVIEW IS INTENDED TO PRESENT A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE IMPORTANT AREAS AND CONCEPTS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS RELEVANT TO CLINICAL PRACTICE INDICATING THOSE THAT REMAIN CONTROVERSIAL AND OFFERING OPINIONS BASED ON BOTH RELEVANT LITERATURE AND THE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE OF THE CLEVELAND CYSTIC FIBROSIS CENTER THE SWEAT TEST TESTS OF PANCREATIC FUNCTION TESTS OF PULMONARY FUNCTION GENETICS AND FAMILY HISTORY IN DIAGNOSIS INFERTILITY AS A DIAGNOSTIC FACTOR THE ROLE OF CIRCULATING FACTORS IN DIAGNOSIS HETEROZYGOTE DETECTION AND PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS MISCELLANEOUS FACTORS LEADING TO DIAGNOSIS NEONATAL SCREENING AND GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF CF ARE EXAMINED A PHILOSOPHY OF TREATMENT PHYSICAL MEASURES ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY AEROSOL THERAPY THE ROLE OF HOSPITALIZATION IN A THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM OTHER DRUG THERAPY THE TREATMENT OF COR PULMONALE RESPIRATORY FAILURE AND SPECIFIC PULMONARY COMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED ENZYME REPLACEMENT AND OBSTRUCTIVE PHENOMENA GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE THE TREATMENT OF THE SWEAT DEFECT PSYCHOSOCIAL THERAPY AND PROGNOSIS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED
1235;APART FROM THE SOUND PHYSIOLOGIC BASIS FOR THE DISTAL SPLENORENAL SHUNT AS COMPARED WITH THE PORTACAVAL SHUNT AND THE CONVENTIONAL CENTRAL SPLENORENAL SHUNT THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT REASONS WHY WE THINK THE USE OF THIS TYPE OF SHUNT IS ESPECIALLY ADVANTAGEOUS IN CHILDREN WITH PORTAL HYPERTENSION SECONDARY TO CYSTIC FIBROSIS FIRSTLY THE THICK FIBROTIC RETROPERITONEAL AREA IN THE PORTA HEPATIS WHERE A PORTACAVAL SHUNT HAS TO BE CONSTRUCTED CAN BE AVOIDED WHICH MAKES THE DISTAL SPLENORENAL SHUNT THE EASIER OPERATION SECONDLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE RELATIVELY SMALL SIZED VESSELS A WIDE ANASTOMOSIS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED WITH A HIGH FLOW RATE AND THEREFORE A MINIMAL CHANCE OF SHUNT THROMBOSIS
1236;RECENTLY WE FOUND THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS MUCOCILIARY INHIBITOR IN URINE FROM HOMOZYGOTES AND HETEROZYGOTES BUT NOT FROM NORMALS IN RECENT STUDIES WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO COMPARE THE RELATIVE CONCENTRATIONS OF CFMI IN MATERIAL FROM HOMOZYGOTES AND HETEROZYGOTES THE UNITES OF INHIBITION WHICH REFLECT THE CONCENTRATION OF THE CFMI IN SERUM AND TISSUE CULTURE MEDIUM FRACTIONS FROM HETEROZYGOTES IS CLOSE TO ONE HALF OF THAT IN FRACTIONS FROM HOMOZYGOUS SOURCES WITH PURIFICATION OF THE CFMI AND THE GENERATION OF A MONOSPECIFIC ANTIBODY PREPARATION ANSWERS WILL BECOME AVAILABLE TO THE QUESTIONS OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A NORMAL COUNTERPART TO THE CFMI AND WHETHER OR NOT QUANTITATION OF THE CFMI WILL BE USEFUL IN HETEROZYGOTE DETECTION AND PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS
1237;TESTS CLAIMED TO DETECT SMALL AIRWAY DISEASE WERE EVALUATED IN CHILDREN FIFTY TWO SUBJECTS WHO WERE NORMAL WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS CF AND WITH ASTHMA WERE SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF NORMAL SPIROMETRY INFORMED CONSENT BEING OBTAINED FROM THEM AND THEIR PARENTS TESTS UNDERTAKEN WERE MEASUREMENT OF MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY FLOW VOLUME CURVES BREATHING AIR AND A HELIUM OXYGEN MIXTURE SINGLE BREATH NITROGEN WASHOUT CURVES LUNG VOLUMES AND EXCEPT IN THE NORMAL SUBJECTS MEASUREMENT OF ARTERIAL OXYGEN TENSION CLOSING VOLUMES WERE NORMAL IN MOST CHILDREN WITH CF AND ASTHMA WHEREAS THE SLOPE OF THE ALVEOLAR PLATEAU WAS ABNORMAL IN MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE AT OF TOTAL LUNG CAPACITY WAS REDUCED IN AND MAXIMUM MID EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE IN RESIDUAL VOLUME INCREASED IN AND RESULTS OF OTHER TESTS WERE ABNORMAL IN LESS THAN OF THE CHILDREN THERE WAS EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT LUNG DISEASE WAS MORE PATCHY IN CHILDREN WITH MILD CF THAN IN THOSE WITH INTERVAL PHASE ASTHMA THESE TESTS DO NOT DETECT SPECIFIC PATHOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN SMALL AIRWAYS BUT REFLECT THE CONSEQUENCES OF SMALL AIRWAY ABNORMALITIES WHICH MAY VARY IN THE SAME DISEASE AS WELL AS IN DIFFERENT DISEASES NO ONE TEST ALONE APPEARS MOST USEFUL TOGETHER THEY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALITIES PRESENT IN EACH INDIVIDUAL
1238;WE THEORIZE THAT CYSTIC FIBROSIS MAY BE A DISEASE IN WHICH A PLASMA FACTOR WITH LECTIN LIKE ACTIVITY STIMULATES MUCUS SECRETION CAUSES PRECIPITATION OF MUCUS GLYCOPROTEINS AND INCIDENTALLY AFFECTS LYMPHOCYTES IN CULTURE TO CONFIRM OUR THEORY WE PLANNED TO SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL LECTIN LIKE ACTIVITIES IN CF SERUM OUR EXPERIMENTS SUGGEST THAT THE LECTIN LIKE SUBSTANCE IN CF BLOOD REQUIRES IGM FOR ITS RED BLOOD CELL AGGLUTINATION ACTIVITY THUS NO DIFFERENCE IN AGGLUTINATION TITER IS OBSERVED BETWEEN CF HOMOZYGOTES AND HETEROZYGOTES BECAUSE IGM IS THE LIMITING FACTOR AND IGM CONCENTRATIONS DO NOT DIFFER APPRECIABLY IN SUCH SUBJECTS WE SUSPECT THAT CF HOMOZYGOTES HAVE A LARGER POOL OF FREE LECTIN IN THEIR BLOOD THAN DO HETEROZYGOTES SO THAT QUANTITATION OF THIS FREE LECTIN POOL MAY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO PHENOTYPES EXCESS FREE LECTIN MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF CF WHEREAS LESSER AMOUNTS MAY THEORETICALLY BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE HETEROZYGOTE
1239;IN CHILDREN MALE FEMALE WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AGED MONTHS TO YEARS AND MATCHED CONTROLS TOTAL SERUM VITAMIN E LEVELS AND FATTY ACID PATTERNS OF SERUM CHOLESTEROL ESTERS PHOSPHOLIPIDS AND TRIGLYCERIDES ARE DEMONSTRATED COMPARED TO CONTROLS MG DL THE TOTAL SERUM VITAMIN E LEVELS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IN PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS MG DL P LESS THAN THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE COMPARING THE FATTY ACID PATTERNS OF THE SERUM ESTER FRACTIONS OF BOTH GROUPS DIFFERENCES CAN BE SEEN BEST IN THE CHOLESTEROL ESTER FRACTION IN THIS FRACTION LINOLEIC ACID SHOWS A TREND TO BE DECREASED IN THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP A POSSIBLE INFLUENCE OF HEIGHT VELOCITY ON THE LEVELS OF ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS IS DISCUSSED
